      "title": "Today's Refinance Rates, April 11: Refi Rates Rise As Economic Outlook Darkens",
      "text": "Mortgage refinance rates have been moderating in response to rising layoffs and worries about a potential economic downturn. Despite the recent dip in rates, experts don\u2019t expect another refinancing boom like in 2020 and 2021, when mortgage rates dropped to historic lows.\n\nUntil mortgage rates move below 6%, which isn\u2019t guaranteed this year, refinancing activity is likely to remain limited. Most homeowners refinance to save money on their monthly payment with a lower interest rate. However, you might be considering refinancing for other reasons, such as modifying your loan term or type.\n\nMortgage refinance rates change daily depending on multiple economic and political factors. Check out our weekly mortgage rate forecast for expert predictions on where rates are headed.\n\nToday's average refinance rates\n\n30-year fixed-rate 15-year fixed-rate 30-year fixed-rate jumbo 5/1 ARM 10-year fixed-rate 30-year fixed-rate refinance 15-year fixed-rate refinance 10-year fixed refinance\n\nToday's average mortgage rates on Apr. 15, 2025, compared with one week ago. We use rate data collected by Bankrate as reported by lenders across the US.\n\nWhen mortgage rates start to fall, be ready to take advantage. Experts recommend shopping around and comparing multiple offers to get the lowest rate. Enter your information here to get a custom quote from one of CNET's partner lenders.\n\nAbout these rates: Bankrate's tool features rates from partner lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates.\n\nRefinance rate news\n\nLate last year, mortgage rates climbed back into the 7% range after the Federal Reserve said it would adopt a slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2025 due to limited progress on inflation.\n\nSince then, markets have grown increasingly concerned that the Trump administration's policies, particularly on trade, funding cuts and immigration, will lead to higher unemployment and reduced economic growth. A weakening economy would likely prompt the Fed to resume cutting interest rates in May or June, putting downward pressure on mortgage rates and increasing refinance activity.\n\nWhat to know about 2025 refinance rate expectations\n\nExperts say the Fed's rate cuts could help mortgage interest rates drop further by the end of 2025. However, homeowners shouldn\u2019t expect mortgage refinance rates to suddenly plunge from just one policy move. Though the Fed's benchmark interest rate influences the cost of consumer borrowing, the central bank doesn\u2019t directly control the mortgage market.\n\nOverall, refinance rates will not become significantly more affordable in the next year without multiple interest rate cuts and weaker economic data. It usually takes several months for interest rate adjustments to be reflected in the rates lenders advertise to consumers.\n\nWhat does it mean to refinance?\n\nWhen you refinance your mortgage, you take out another home loan that pays off your initial mortgage. With a traditional refinance, your new home loan will have a different term and/or interest rate. With a cash-out refinance, you\u2019ll tap into your equity with a new loan that\u2019s bigger than your existing mortgage balance, allowing you to pocket the difference in cash.\n\nRefinancing can be a great financial move if you score a low rate or can pay off your home loan in less time, but consider whether it\u2019s the right choice for you. Reducing your interest rate by 1% or more is an incentive to refinance, allowing you to cut your monthly payment significantly.\n\nBut refinancing your mortgage isn\u2019t free. Since you\u2019re taking out a whole new home loan, you\u2019ll need to pay another set of closing costs. If you fall into that pool of homeowners who purchased property when rates were high, consider reaching out to your lender and running the numbers to see whether a mortgage refinance makes sense for your budget, said Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire.\n\nChoosing the right refinance type and term\n\nThe rates advertised online often require specific conditions for eligibility. Your personal interest rate will be influenced by market conditions as well as your specific credit history, financial profile and application. Having a high credit score, a low credit utilization ratio and a history of consistent and on-time payments will generally help you get the best interest rates.\n\n30-year fixed-rate refinance\n\nThe average 30-year fixed refinance rate right now is 6.82%, an increase of 8 basis points compared to one week ago. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) A 30-year fixed refinance will typically have lower monthly payments than a 15-year or 10-year refinance, but it will take you longer to pay off and typically cost you more in interest over the long term.\n\n15-year fixed-rate refinance\n\nFor 15-year fixed refinances, the average rate is currently at 6.10%, an increase of 4 basis points compared to one week ago. Though a 15-year fixed refinance will most likely raise your monthly payment compared to a 30-year loan, you\u2019ll save more money over time because you\u2019re paying off your loan quicker. Also, 15-year refinance rates are typically lower than 30-year refinance rates, which will help you save more in the long run.\n\n10-year fixed-rate refinance\n\nThe average 10-year fixed refinance rate right now is 6.02%, a decrease of 1 basis points compared to one week ago. A 10-year refinance typically has the lowest interest rate but the highest monthly payment of all refinance terms. A 10-year refinance can help you pay off your house much quicker and save on interest, but make sure you can afford the steeper monthly payment.\n\nTo get the best refinance rates, make your application as strong as possible by getting your finances in order, using credit responsibly and monitoring your credit regularly. And don\u2019t forget to speak with multiple lenders and shop around.\n\nWhen to consider a mortgage refinance\n\nHomeowners usually refinance to save money, but there are other reasons to do so. Here are the most common reasons homeowners refinance:",

      "text": "A new survey shows investors haven't felt this dour on the economy in decades, another sign of how heavily Donald Trump's trade war is weighing on sentiment.\n\nAs part of its weekly Global Fund Manager survey, Bank of America took the pulse of 164 fund managers with $386 billion of assets under management.\n\nAs shown by the dark blue in the chart below, global growth expectations have fallen to a 30-year low. The light blue line sees a similar \u2014 although not quite as extreme \u2014 decline in S&P 500 expectations.\n\nPessimism around equities specifically was seen in another measure surveyed by BofA: the number of participants planning to trim exposure to US stocks. As shown below, this fell to a record low.\n\nThe sharp decline in expectations reflects how hard investors have been hit by Trump's Liberation Day tariffs, which helped spark the worst stock sell-off since the pandemic after Trump officially rolled out the tariffs in early April.\n\nThe major indexes have clawed back some of the losses since Trump issued a 90-day pause on most of his tariffs. Still, the S&P 500 is down 12% from its peak in mid-February.\n\nTariffs have worried investors on two fronts. First, markets are antsy about the impact import duties could have on US growth, with chatter about a potential recession making the rounds on Wall Street in recent weeks.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nSecond, traders are worried about the inflationary impact of tariffs, as companies could pass tariff-related price increases onto consumers. Fears of higher inflation are also raising concerns about stagflation, a nightmare scenario for the economy that involves sluggish growth and stubbornly high prices.\n\n80% of fund managers said they believed the biggest tail risk to markets was the trade war triggering a global recession, according to the BofA survey. That's the most concentrated investors have been on a tail risk in 15 years, the bank added.\n\nMeanwhile, 90% of fund managers said they expected to see stagflation in the global economy over the next 12 months. That's the highest stagflation fears have been since 2022.",

      "text": "Dutch multinational health technology company Royal Philips is doubling down on its long-term commitment to China, banking on the country's accelerating shift toward smart, digital and sustainable healthcare under the Health China 2030 blueprint and its high-quality development agenda.\n\n\"The China market is very important for Philips. It's around 10 percent of our total global revenue,\" Roy Jakobs, CEO of Royal Philips, said during a recent interview with China Daily. \"We are very excited about the strength and the outlook of the Chinese economy.\"\n\nDespite ongoing global uncertainties and rising geopolitical tensions, Philips remains optimistic about China's economic prospects \u2014 betting on opportunities arising from China's aging population, continued healthcare reform and rapidly advancing digital ecosystem to drive sustainable business growth.\n\nJakobs noted signs of stabilization in the economy, supported by both consumer activity and healthcare demand.\n\n\"We see consumer confidence and consumer spending rising, which is really encouraging,\" he said. \"On the healthcare side, we see a strong fundamental need for supporting patients and the growing elderly population in China. We see healthy fundamentals in China. And we believe this will strengthen now and in the years to come.\"\n\nHaving established its first joint venture in China four decades ago, Philips has embedded local research and development and innovation into its China strategy. The company currently operates five innovation hubs in the country, with approximately 90 percent of its products sold in China being locally manufactured and delivered.\n\n\"We see China as a source of inspiration for innovation and for talent, and it's an ecosystem that we leverage for the benefit of global delivery of products and services,\" Jakobs added.\n\n\"There are around 10 million engineering talents graduating in China every year. China's strong clinical base \u2014 which includes strong and large-scale hospitals that serve numerous patients \u2014 provides rich opportunities to accumulate research interests, experience and data. And China's strong supply chain enables innovation and competitive product development.\"\n\nSo far, the company has more than 7,000 patents in China, and the company has said that it will strengthen its innovation hubs and establish a new one in Beijing.\n\nWith rising demand for artificial intelligence-powered medical solutions and growing momentum in green and digital hospital development, Philips is doubling down on its \"In China, For China\" strategy, while also leveraging Chinese innovations for global application.\n\n\"We look at the specific consumer needs in China. At the same time, we use China as a base to provide services to the world,\" Jakobs said. \"If we think about the opportunities that China offers, the scale of patients actually gives us a very interesting pool of data and experience and clinical evidence that we can use to develop relevant solutions for China and for the world.\"\n\nPhilips is ramping up investment in AI development to address healthcare bottlenecks, including the significant gap between growing demand and insufficient supply.\n\n\"With the application of the latest technology of software and AI, we can scan more patients, and treat more patients with minimally invasive therapies in a day, in a week in the hospitals as well as outside of the hospital,\" Jakobs said.\n\nIn parallel, Philips will continue to enhance its hardware capabilities in China. \"We keep expanding and seeking how we can deliver the best products and services to the Chinese market from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, which is a very important site for us to develop the latest hardware,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Government Work Report, China will strive to develop new quality productive forces in light of local conditions and accelerate the development of a modernized industrial system.\n\nLi Chao, chief economist at Zheshang Securities, said developing new quality productive forces will be key to boosting China's long-term growth potential, with AI and other emerging fields set for intensified development.\n\nJakobs said China's push to cultivate new quality productive forces aligns with Philips' strategy to scale up local innovation and bolster its innovation infrastructure in the country.\n\n\"The strength of the Chinese market from an innovation perspective is that the government is supporting the ecosystem,\" he noted.\n\nLooking forward, Jakobs sees a steady macroeconomic outlook and clear policy direction \u2014 particularly around innovation, sustainability, and healthcare digitization \u2014 as reasons to remain bullish on the Chinese market.\n\n\"China is a very significant country with a huge population in need of a sufficient and good healthcare system,\" Jakobs said. \"We need to invest in productivity to serve more patients, and deliver better and more care.\"",

      "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will hold a snap presidential election within 60 days after the Constitutional Court unanimously removed President Yoon Suk Yeol from office on Friday, upholding his impeachment for imposing martial law last year.\n\nPresidents can serve a single five-year term in South Korea, and recent opinion polls show the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party is well ahead, though he faces his own legal challenges.\n\nHere are some potential contenders for the presidential election.\n\nLEE JAE-MYUNG\n\nThe Democratic Party leader is regarded as by far the top contender. The veteran politician lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election by the slimmest margin in history.\n\nLeading by double-digits in some recent polls, Lee is among the lawmakers who rushed to the National Assembly on the night of Yoon's December 3 martial law declaration to ensure parliament voted down the military order.\n\nLee, 61, led his party to a landslide victory in a parliamentary election last year and enjoys strong support from liberal voters.\n\nStill, Lee has his own court battles. Although a court threw out his guilty verdict on charges of violating the election law, he faces several trials on matters ranging from bribery to charges mostly linked to a $1-billion property development scandal.\n\nIn 2024, he survived a knife attack at an event and underwent surgery for stabs to the neck.\n\nHAN DONG-HOON\n\nThe ex-leader of South Korea's ruling People Power Party is considered a top conservative contender. He was a particularly vocal opponent of Yoon's martial law declaration.\n\nThe 51-year-old prosecutor-turned-politician resigned as PPP leader amid friction in the party over his call for Yoon to resign over the martial law declaration.\n\nHan is popular with moderate conservative voters but faced criticism from Yoon supporters who accused Han of betraying his party and allowing Yoon's impeachment by the National Assembly in December.\n\nKIM MOON-SOO\n\nThe labour minister has been polling higher than other conservative contenders, though he has said he was not considering running for the presidency.\n\nKim, like many other conservative politicians, criticised the arrest of Yoon and the impeachment hearings conducted by the Constitutional Court.\n\nThe 73-year-old would likely be the oldest candidate if he decides to run.\n\nOH SE-HOON\n\nThe conservative four-term mayor of Seoul is an advocate for South Korea to consider nuclear armament to counter arch rival North Korea.\n\n\"Along with having nuclear potential, we need to be prepared to put our own nuclear weapons on the table as a possible strategic option,\" he posted on Facebook in January.\n\nOh this year unveiled his regulatory reform slogan \"KOGA (Korea Growth Again)\", inspired by U.S. President Donald Trump's MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement.\n\nOh's reforms target boosting the economic growth rate to 5% from last year's 2%.\n\nHONG JOON-PYO\n\nHong, mayor of the conservative stronghold Daegu, has said he is preparing for the next presidential election even while calling for the Constitutional Court not to oust Yoon.\n\nThe five-term lawmaker for the PPP and its predecessors lost the 2017 presidential election to Moon Jae-in.\n\nHong has been a vocal critic of ruling party former leader Han for distancing himself from Yoon.\n\nKIM DONG-YEON\n\nThe governor of Gyeonggi Province has emerged as another potential contender from the opposition.\n\nKim told Reuters in January that \"there might be tough times ahead of us, especially for countries like Korea\" and that the alliance between Seoul and Washington will be \"very concrete\", whoever heads the administration.\n\nHe said whoever stands for the Democratic Party should win the election.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunsu Yim; Additional Reporting by Joyce Lee and Echo Wang in Davos; Editing by Ed Davies, Michael Perry and William Mallard)",

      "text": "United States President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order that he argues is aimed at tightening election rules ahead of the 2026 midterms, touching upon a claim he has frequently made \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of large-scale election fraud.\n\nTitled \u201cPreserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\u201d the new order introduces strict new requirements that voters must meet in order to cast their ballot.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nKey aspects of the new executive order\n\nProof of Citizenship Requirement:\n\nTo prevent non-Americans from voting in a federal election \u2013 an act that is already illegal and punishable by prison time and deportation \u2013 the order requires voters to submit official proof of US citizenship, such as a US passport or a birth certificate.\n\nFederal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, will be required to share data to help state officials identify non-citizens on voter rolls. However, voting rights groups have raised concerns that the citizenship requirements could lead to voter disenfranchisement.\n\n\u201cThis would prevent only a tiny amount of noncitizen voter registration but stop millions of eligible voters, who do not have easy access to documents such as passports, from registering to vote,\u201d Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a blog post.\n\nThere are also concerns that married women who have changed their last names may face difficulties registering to vote, as their birth certificates reflect their maiden names.\n\nThe advocacy group Public Citizen pointed out that roughly 146 million Americans do not have a passport.\n\nBallot submission deadline:\n\nAll mail ballots are required to be received by Election Day to be counted according to the executive order, aiming to standardise the voting process across states. \u200b\n\nAcross the country, states currently have wide latitude to administer elections differently \u2013 but none allow votes to be counted if they are cast after Election Day.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonprofit organisation, 18 states, including battleground states, currently accept mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day, provided they are postmarked on or before that day.\n\nCalifornia, the most populous state in the country, is often cited for its prolonged vote-counting process \u2013 it allows ballots to be counted up to seven days after the election, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nFederal funding conditions:\n\nStates that do not comply with some of these new requirements risk losing federal election funding. \u200b\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General shall take appropriate action against states that count ballots received after Election Day in Federal elections. Federal election funding will be conditioned on compliance,\u201d the executive order says.\n\nThis could place significant financial pressure on states, especially those that currently allow more flexible voting procedures.\n\nElectoral campaign financing happens at the federal, state and local levels, with funding coming from individuals, corporations, political action committees (PACs), and, in some cases, government.\n\n\u200bIn March 2024, the US Congress allocated $55m in new federal funding to states under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to enhance the administration and security of federal elections. \u200b\n\nThis funding was distributed among all US states and territories based on a predetermined formula, which considers factors such as the size of the voting-age population.\n\nData sharing and prosecution:\n\nTrump\u2019s order also instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, to ensure that states have access to systems capable of verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote.\n\nIt also directs the Department of Homeland Security, along with an official from the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, to review state voter registration lists \u2013 and, if needed, use subpoenas \u2013 to ensure compliance with federal standards.\n\n\u201cDOGE certainly has no power to kick people off rolls. But they could make a lot of noise trying to claim they\u2019ve found fraud when they find that voter registration rolls are not being kept up to date,\u201d Richard Hasen wrote.\n\nWill this new order face challenges?\n\nTrump\u2019s order is likely to face legal challenges, given that the Constitution gives authority over elections to the states.\n\nArizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said he and state Attorney General Kris Mayes are already in discussions about a possible lawsuit, describing the executive order as \u201can attempt to federalise elections\u201d.\n\nFontes said that the order appears aimed at creating the illusion of misconduct in the electoral process, potentially to justify \u201ccancelling the election later\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very methodical, and very, very dangerous,\u201d he said in an interview with Votebeat , a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom focused specifically on US elections, on Tuesday. \u201cYou have to pay attention not to what the executive order says, but what the end game may be. I believe the end game may be that Donald Trump wants to stay in office in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nWho is supporting this new order?\n\nConservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation, praised the order.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is finally taking the action long needed to put the resources of federal agencies like the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to work helping states, instead of trying to hinder their efforts to reform our election process, which was an unfortunate hallmark of the Biden administration,\u201d Hans von Spakovsky, who leads the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative wrote in a statement.",

      "title": "Climate change is supercharging pollen and making allergies worse",
      "text": "4 days ago\n\nAmanda Ruggeri\n\nSeasonal allergy sufferers are being hit with more pollen over a longer season due to rising temperatures, but global warming is also triggering alarming extreme allergy events, say experts.\n\nPeople could see the thunderstorm, but they couldn't see what was going on inside it. Trillions of pollen particles, sucked up into the clouds as the storm formed, were now being splintered by rain, lightning and humidity into ever-smaller fragments \u2013 then cast back down to Earth for people to breathe them in.\n\nIt was around 18:00 on 21 November 2016 when the air in Melbourne, Australia, turned deadly. Emergency service phone lines lit up, people struggling to breathe began flooding into hospitals, and there was so much demand for ambulances that the vehicles were unable to reach patients stuck at home. Emergency rooms saw eight times as many people turning up with breathing problems as they would normally expect. Nearly 10 times as many people with asthma were admitted to hospital.\n\nIn total, 10 people died, including a 20-year-old law student who passed away on her lawn, waiting for an ambulance while her family tried to resuscitate her. One survivor described how he had been breathing normally and then, within 30 minutes, found himself gasping for air. \"It was insane,\" he told reporters from his hospital bed.\n\nPaul Beggs, an environmental health scientist and professor at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, remembers the incident well. \"It was an absolutely massive event. Unprecedented. Catastrophic,\" he says. \"The people in Melbourne, the doctors and the nurses and the people in pharmacies \u2013 they all didn't know what was happening.\"\n\nIt soon became clear that this was a massive case of \"thunderstorm asthma\", which occurs when certain types of storms break up pollen particles in the air, releasing proteins and showering them on unsuspecting people below. The widely dispersed proteins can trigger allergic reactions in some people \u2013 even among those who weren't previously asthmatic.\n\nThunderstorm asthma events like the one that hit Melbourne are one extreme example of how pollen from plants and the allergies it causes are being dramatically altered by climate change. As temperatures rise, many regions \u2013 especially the US, Europe and Australia \u2013 are seeing seasonal allergies affect an increasing proportion of people, over a longer season and with worse symptoms, say scientists.\n\nThis year, in the US, pollen levels are predicted to be higher than the historical average across 39 states this season. And that is only likely to get worse in the years to come, experts warn.\n\nPollen itself is an essential and ever-present part of our world. These microscopic particles pass between plants, enabling them to reproduce. While some plants spread their pollen with the help of insects, others rely on the wind, sending huge volumes of this powdery substance airborne. Many trees, grasses and weed species rely upon wind dispersal for their pollen. It is these that are especially likely to cause seasonal allergies, or hay fever.\n\nThis occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response normally reserved for pathogenic bacteria or viruses. Common symptoms can include a runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. In some cases, seasonal allergies can trigger breathing difficulties when inflammation in the airways leads to swelling, making it hard to get enough air into the lungs.\n\nEvery time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed responded. There was some evidence they were producing a more allergenic form of pollen \u2013 Lewis Ziska\n\nWhile Melbourne has been the unlucky epicentre of thunderstorm asthma, with seven thunderstorm asthma major events recorded since 1984, similar incidents have occurred around the world, from Birmingham in the UK to Atlanta in the US. Although these are still rare events, climate change may be increasing the likelihood of thunderstorm asthma incidents, in part because it is extending pollen seasons, but also because it is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, including storms.\n\nWhile it isn't possible to determine exactly how much climate change influenced the 2016 thunderstorm asthma incident in Melbourne, Beggs is \"reasonably certain\" it had some impact.\n\n\"We know that climate change is leading to greater amounts of pollen in the atmosphere,\" he says. \"It's changing the seasonality of the pollen. It's changing the types of pollen that we're exposed to.\" Beggs, who has researched thunderstorm asthma extensively, published a paper in 2024 that examined the links between this phenomenon and climate change.\n\nHow thunderstorms supercharge pollen\n\nExactly how thunderstorms trigger or exacerbate asthma in this way is still not fully understood. The leading theory is that cold air downdrafts that occur during thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds that blow at ground level, whipping up pollen grains and fungal spores from grass and plants. These then get carried high into the storm system by updrafts, where moisture in the clouds causes them to swell and break apart into smaller fragments, massively increasing the number of allergen particles in the air. The strong electric field that develops during thunderstorms may also enhance the rupture of the pollen.\n\nThis smaller particle size makes it easier for the pollen fragments to get into the airways as they are carried back to ground-level by cold down-draft winds. Pollen levels seem to spike during the first 20-30 minutes of a thunderstorm, according to studies on the phenomenon. Younger people seem to be particularly affected.\n\nThankfully, major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare. But climate change is increasing people's risk of pollen exposure in other ways, too.\n\nFor one thing, rising temperatures mean that pollen seasons \u2013 when plants emit pollen, typically during spring and summer \u2013 are starting earlier and lasting longer, says Elaine Fuertes, a public health scientist who focuses on the environment and allergic disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, UK. \"You're going to get people who experience symptoms earlier in the year, for a longer period of time,\" she says.\n\nIn parts of the world, including the US and Europe, one of the key culprits is ragweed \u2013 a widespread group of flowering plants that many people consider to be weeds. There are various species of ragweed around the world but they can produce mind-bending amounts of pollen. A single plant is capable of emitting one billion pollen grains, for example. Ragweed grows in gardens and farmland but also in nooks and crannies in urban environments.\n\nAllergies to ragweed pollen already affect some 50 million people in the US alone. A study analysing data from 11 locations in North America between 1995 to 2015 found that 10 of those locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons \u2013 sometimes much longer. During that 20-year period, the season lengthened by 25 days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 days in Fargo, North Dakota and 18 days in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n\"The winter warms, the springs are starting earlier, and the falls are being delayed, and so the time that you spend outdoors in contact with allergic pollen is definitely going up,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University, in New York, US, and one of the scientists who researched the ragweed pollen season.\n\nThese changes get more drastic in northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia, Ziska says. But also in Australia and the southern parts of South America and Africa.\n\nWithout immediate cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the effect is likely to only get worse. One 2022 study, for example, estimated that, by the end of the century, pollen seasons will begin up to 40 days earlier and end up to 15 days later than they do now \u2013 potentially meaning an additional two months of symptoms for hay fever sufferers per year.\n\nIt isn't just that people are being exposed to allergens for longer. It is also that the amount of allergens in the air are increasing in many parts of the world. In the 2000s, the pollen season in the continental US started three days earlier than it did during the 1990s, but crucially, the amount of pollen in the air was also 46% higher.\n\nThis is partly because carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere are rising, due to emissions from human activities. And many of the most bothersome plants for hay fever sufferers thrive on CO2.\n\nWhen researchers grew a certain type of grass under different CO2 levels, for example, they found that plants grown in an atmosphere containing CO2 at 800 parts per million (ppm) had flowers that produced about 50% more pollen than plants grown in air containing 400ppm. The latter mimics current levels of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nSimilarly, other scientists have also experimented with growing different types of oak tree, the pollen from which often causes hay fever in countries such as South Korea. Under a 720ppm CO2 scenario, they found that each oak tree had an average pollen count 13 times what the trees had under a 400ppm scenario. Even at 560ppm, pollen production was 3.5 times higher than current levels.\n\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies\n\n\u2022 How light pollution disrupts plants' senses\n\n\u2022 The science of probiotics and skin\n\nZiska, who authored the 2022 book Greenhouse Planet, ran similar experiments with ragweed. His results mirror those of other researchers. \"Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed plants responded. They grew more. They produced more pollen,\" he says. \"And there was some evidence that they were producing a more allergenic form of the pollen, one that could induce your immune system to respond even to a greater extent than had been in the past.\"\n\nThe spread of invasive species across new parts of the world is also triggering allergic reactions in new populations of people. While originally from North America, ragweed, for example, has spread across Europe, as well as into Australia, Asia and South America. Already, some 60% of people in Hungary, 20% in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands are reportedly sensitive to the pollen from this prolific group of plants.\n\nThis makes it especially concerning that, by 2050, the concentration of ragweed pollen in the air is estimated to be about four times what it is today. Even in parts of Europe where ragweed pollen is virtually absent at present, including southern UK and Germany, \"pollen loads become substantial\" under both moderate or high-end climate scenarios, researchers wrote in a 2015 study.\n\nAbout one-third of the increase is due to the continuing spread of the invasive species, the researchers note. The remaining two-thirds is specifically due to climate change, including the lengthening of the growing season as temperatures warm. \"So it'll be an earlier season, a longer season, as well as a more intense season for those who experience allergic symptoms \u2013 and then a higher risk of new sensitisation for a previously unexposed population,\" Fuertes says.\n\nNot every region in the world will see more pollen production. Some researchers have found that southern California, for example, will experience earlier but less productive pollen seasons, largely as a result of reduced rainfall.\n\nBut these predictions don't account for all the potential effects of climate change on airborne allergens. There could also be health impacts from the increased likelihood of wildfires, for example, because this raises the risk of both asthma and allergy symptoms.\n\nRelatively speaking, the amount of pollen in the air will still vary from year to year, Fuertes points out. But that may not be of much help to hay fever sufferers. \"Once you're sensitised and go on to develop allergic symptoms, you'll still likely experience symptoms during years when pollen levels may be lower than average,\" she says. \"You'll react to the pollen that's around.\"\n\nIt might be possible to make some drastic but direct interventions, for example. A century ago, some US cities even set up commissions to tackle ragweed. \"Chicago employs 1,350 in hay fever fight,\" blares one headline from 1932. The news story explains that men \u2013 otherwise unemployed during the Great Depression \u2013 were paid the equivalent of one week's food and lodging (and \"25 cents in cash\") for each day they spent cutting down the plant.\n\nWhile this might sound quaint, it made a difference. A 1956 study of New York City's \"Operation Ragweed\" estimated that cutting down the plant in droves cut pollen production by about 50%. Today, it is in Europe where you can find coordinated action ongoing. In Berlin, workers have been dispatched to find and eliminate ragweed around the city, while Switzerland banned the import or sale of the plant in 2024 and established volunteer groups patrolling public parks to pull it out.\n\nOther solutions lie in smarter urban design. \"We should definitely green our cities,\" Fuertes says. \"But we do need to do it thoughtfully.\"\n\nPlanting of exotic species, for example, can trigger new allergies. Opting for the male, pollen producing trees in some species over \"messy\" fruit and seed producing female ones \u2013 so-called \"botanical sexism\" \u2013 can also increase pollen levels in urban areas, although studies have shown the effect of this bias is relatively small in major cities such as New York.\n\nIt is also important to monitor and forecast pollen levels, scientists say. \"We need to know what we're breathing in. That's a pretty fundamental thing in terms of our health,\" says Beggs, who points out that while most people take it for granted that they can get reliable, real-time, validated information on metrics like temperature or rainfall in their area, relatively few can say the same for airborne allergens.\n\nBut even those services that are modelling pollen counts in an extensive, detailed way \u2013 such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute \u2013 aren't monitoring or modelling airborne allergen levels, which are more accurate as each pollen grain can release different amounts of allergens and they can vary by the weather conditions. These are a different measurement, Fuertes points out, and one that she's shown is more closely linked to allergy symptoms. \"Nobody is measuring allergen levels on a routine basis,\" Fuertes says. \"We should be moving towards that.\"\n\nOverall, experts say, the science is clear. Without concrete, coordinated action, climate change will continue to make hay fever worse across many regions of the world. This might include more dramatic, deadly events like thunderstorm asthma. But it might also mean more people sniffling and suffering, for a longer season, every year.\n\n\"We have the studies now to show that it's really having an impact on human health,\" says Beggs. \"And there's more to come.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

      "text": "Climate extremes: Europe experienced its warmest year on record in 2024, made evident by extreme weather events that caused devastating impacts across the continent\n\nAccording to the newly released European State of the Climate 2024 (ESOTC 2024) report, prepared by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the effects of climate change were widespread and severe, especially in Eastern and southern eastern Europe.\n\nThe ESOTC report and examining climate extremes\n\nThe annual ESOTC report, which involves around 100 scientific contributors, offers an in-depth overview of Europe\u2019s climate conditions.\n\nProviding details on trends beyond just temperature, including heat stress, drought, sunshine duration, flooding, and glacier retreat.\n\nThe 2024 edition includes a new graphics gallery with 130 charts and infographics to help visualise these changes.\n\nEastern and southeastern Europe hit the hardest\n\nEurope has been warming faster than any other continent, and the report confirms that 2024 set a new temperature record. Central, eastern, and southeastern Europe experienced exceptional heat, while western regions were warmer than average but significantly wetter.\n\nThis east-west contrast led to different but equally damaging weather events across the continent.\n\nFlooding was revealed as one of the most destructive conditions in 2024. About 30% of Europe\u2019s river network crossed the \u2018high\u2019 flood threshold during the year, and 12% reached \u2018severe\u2019 levels. Storm Boris, one of the year\u2019s most impactful weather events, struck in September and caused widespread flooding across Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania, and Italy. Hundreds of thousands of people were affected, with many lives lost and extensive damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\nIn October, Spain faced a flooding emergency when extreme rainfall hit the province of Valencia and neighbouring regions. This event caused deadly flash floods and highlighted how both sudden storms and prolonged rainfall events are increasing in frequency and intensity.\n\nAlongside the floods, southeastern Europe endured the region\u2019s most prolonged recorded heatwave. Lasting 13 days in July, the heatwave affected over half the region and set new records for the number of days with intense heat stress, defined by dangerous levels of heat impacting human health. The area experienced 66 days with intense heat stress and 23 tropical nights, where temperatures didn\u2019t fall below 20\u00baC, offering little relief.\n\nLong term trend point to escalating risk\n\nThe report also emphasises longer-term trends, incorporating insights from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nEurope is expected to face some of the world\u2019s most significant increases in flood risk as global temperatures rise. If global warming reaches 1.5\u00baC above pre-industrial levels, it could result in up to 30,000 heat-related deaths annually in Europe.\n\nNot only is the ESOTC there to provide climate analysis, but it also hopes to inform policy and preparedness. By showing these extreme weather patterns and long-term risks, the report emphasises the need for urgent action to adapt infrastructure, improve disaster readiness, and reduce emissions.\n\nAs each year passes, Europe experiences more severe and frequent climate extremes. The 2024 data creates a clear picture: climate change is no longer a future concern, it is a current and intensifying reality, with human lives, ecosystems, and economies all feeling the impact.",

      "title": "\u2018Getting Heavier\u2019: Climate Change Primes Storms to Drop More Rain",
      "text": "The severe storm system that has inundated the central and southeastern United States with heavy rain and high winds for days fits into a broader pattern in recent decades of increasing rainfall across the eastern half of the United States.\n\nData from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for 1991 through 2020 show that the Eastern part of the country received more rain, on average, over those years than it did during the 20th century. At the same time, precipitation decreased across the West.\n\nThe sharp east-west divide is consistent with predictions from climate scientists, who expect wet places to get wetter, and dry areas to get drier, as the world warms.\n\nWhile no individual storm can be tied to climate change without further analysis, warming air can result in heavier rainfall. That\u2019s because warm air has the ability to hold more moisture than cooler air, fueling conditions for more average precipitation overall, and the potential for storms that come through to be more intense.\n\nGlobal temperatures have been increasing year after year, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which pumps planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The past 10 years have been the 10 hottest in nearly 200 years of record-keeping, according to a recent report from the World Meteorological Organization.\n\n\u201cWhen we have these very heavy rain events, the trends have been pointing toward those heavy events getting heavier,\u201d said Deanna Hence, an associate professor of climate meteorology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nSevere floods can be an indirect effect of the warming air and increased moisture, said Jerald Brotzge, the state climatologist for Kentucky and director of the Kentucky Climate Center. When conditions cause a storm system to stall, it can drop large amounts of rain over the same area, increasing the risk of flooding.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened as this storm stalled in the region in recent days. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a once-in-a-generation event, based on the amounts and the area covered,\u201d Dr. Brotzge said.\n\nMark Jarvis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Louisville, Ky., described the storm as two-pronged. It brought tornadoes, high winds and hail at the front end, before stalling and dropping historic amounts of rainfall. Western Kentucky, which saw some of the storm\u2019s most severe effects, was \u201cin the bull's-eye of it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile heavy rains and floods are common in the Ohio Valley in late winter and early spring, for a system to drop as much rain as this one is \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you usually see with hurricanes and tropical systems,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile damaging storms have always happened, the possibility that climate change is amping them up is corroborated in the weather trends that have been observed, Dr. Hence said.\n\nShe said that even in the Western half of the U.S., which has become drier overall, the precipitation that does come has had a tendency to fall at more extreme levels.\n\nShe called it \u201cvery eye-popping,\u201d and added, \u201cTo think that we\u2019re in for more of this is not a particularly pleasant feeling to have.\u201d",

      "text": "IRA FLATOW: Every week, it feels like there\u2019s another AI advance. Some company produces a system that will write proposals better than you can, or makes more lifelike pictures of videos, or wrangles data in a new way. And most of these systems are still limited to a few specialized tricks in what they can do.\n\nBut how close are companies to creating something that can virtually think on its own or outperform humans on any task? what researchers are calling AGI\u2013 Artificial General Intelligence. And that\u2019s what we are talking about this hour. And we want to hear from you.\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: Yes, how do you feel about this AGI advance? Is it something you\u2019re looking forward to, or are you dreading it? What are your hopes or your fears for how AGI might impact your life? Call us. Our number is 877-925-9174. That\u2019s 877-925-9174.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Let\u2019s get into this. Let me introduce our guests. Will Douglas Heaven is a senior editor for AI coverage at MIT Technology Review. He\u2019s based in the UK. Welcome back.\n\nWILL HEAVEN: Hi, it\u2019s good to be back.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Nice to have you. And Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, founder and CEO of Parity Consulting and the responsible AI fellow at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard. You know where that is\u2013 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She\u2019s also a visiting researcher at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and she\u2019s with us in our New York studios. Welcome back.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Thank you.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Nice to have you. Everybody\u2019s heard of AGI. Will, what do we mean when we say AGI? What does that mean? How is it defined?\n\nWILL HEAVEN: I have no idea.\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nAnd that\u2019s\u2013\n\nIRA FLATOW: Thank you, folks.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: And we\u2019re done.\n\nWILL HEAVEN: The end. No, seriously\u2013 I mean, that is a fascinating question. My whole problem with AGI, the term, is it means so many different things to different people, and it\u2019s sort of it\u2019s changed its meaning over the last few years. But for the sake of getting the conversation going, what it seems to mean to people now\u2013 the companies putting out their blog posts and their manifestos about what they\u2019re building\u2013 is an AI system that can do a wide range of tasks, cognitive tasks, as well as a human can.\n\nThat\u2019s about as good a definition as you\u2019re going to find. But, I mean, my problem is that there\u2019s so many words in that themselves need defining. Like, what is a cognitive task? What does it mean to do it as well as a human? How many cognitive tasks do we need to call an AI system an AGI? Yeah, we\u2019ll get on to this, I\u2019m sure. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Rumman?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: So that\u2019s the question of the hour, of the day, the year. And it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s on purpose. It\u2019s to leave the vagueness where we fill in the narrative ourselves and scare ourselves. But actually, if you look at what OpenAI has defined AGI as, it\u2019s the automation of tasks of economic value.\n\nAnd this is what happens when corporations get to define what intelligence means. They pin it to things that are economically productive. And I think that is a very important distinction from simply saying cognitive tasks. And Will\u2019s right. Yesterday, DeepMind had a blog post where they pretty much defined it as the automation of most human cognitive tasks. And I agree with Will. Who knows what that means?\n\nIRA FLATOW: Does that mean self-awareness?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: It absolutely does not mean self-awareness. Intelligence and sentience are two totally different things\u2013 completely different things.\n\nWILL HEAVEN: If you think AGI is a muddy question, then sentience then\u2013 we\u2019ll be here for ages and not get anywhere.\n\nIRA FLATOW: So so far, I\u2019ve mentioned things like chatbots, like questions that get answered and things that make images or video clips. But how do you make the leap from something that\u2019s good at doing these sorts of things, Rumman, to something that\u2019s good at doing all sorts of things?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: How do you make the technical leap?\n\nIRA FLATOW: Yeah, what is that leap? How is that done? Is it learning, teaching computers to do different things? Is it sucking all the energy up like we hear these computers do?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: I mean, if we\u2019re going to pin this to defining AGI, I think the goal would be that it\u2019s able to do these tasks without us explicitly teaching the model to do so. What\u2019s captured the imagination with generative artificial intelligence is that it seems as if we\u2019re just handing over a pile of random looking information, and it\u2019s putting together patterns, these models.\n\nAnd that is actually an impressive feat. What it is alive, or replacing humans, et cetera. I think what these things are in the real world is very, very different from just capability performance. So one of the interesting things to think about is, when these new models come out\u2013 and like you said, they seem to come out like three a week, and they say it\u2019s performing better than x, y, and z, the important thing to ask is, what is the measurement by which we\u2019re saying it\u2019s so impressive? And that\u2019s publicly out there.\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: I want to bring AI into this conversation.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Like, literally an AI?\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: Yeah, literally an AI. I asked Google\u2019s AI assistant, Gemini, what we should ask you two. And we workshopped it a few times, but here\u2019s where we got. And let\u2019s see what you guys have to say about this.\n\nGEMINI: If I could only ask one question to AI experts about AGI and humanity\u2019s preparation, it would be, considering the inherent uncertainties surrounding the development and capabilities of AGI, what is the single most proactive and universally beneficial step that humanity should take now to prepare for its potential arrival, regardless of the specific form AGI might take. This question aims to\u2013\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: It goes on, and on, and on.\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: I\u2019m going to punt that one to Will.\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: What is the most proactive and universally beneficial step humanity should take to prepare for AGI\u2019s arrival?\n\nWILL HEAVEN: I mean, this is I don\u2019t think AGI is coming anytime soon. And like, I\u2019m not really sure what that would be when it came. So just like a little side note there\u2013 I think at some point probably soon, because so many companies have said they\u2019re building it and it is around the corner, probably someone will just make a definition and say, we\u2019re calling this thing we\u2019ve just made AGI.\n\nSo if the question that Gemini is asking is, what do we need to do to prepare for that, then it kind of depends what that is. But more constructively, I would like us to get off this obsession with AGI and focus on the specific technical advances that we are seeing that are coming along really fast. And it\u2019s so easy to sort of\u2013 dismissing the idea that AGI is around the corner is not to dismiss how amazing the advances have been in video generation, in chatbots over the last few years.\n\nI\u2019m constantly wowed. And it\u2019s wonderful doing my job, like seeing the latest thing that\u2019s come out and talking to the people that are making it. I\u2019m constantly awed by how good this tech has got. And I\u2019d like to just sit with the capabilities that we have and think about what impacts those are going to have on the world. And there\u2019s enough to deal with just with the AI we have today without spending so many hours and words about preparing for AGI.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Well, let me go to Samuel in Rochester, New York, who may have some words like that. Samuel, welcome to Science Friday.\n\nSAMUEL: Hi, can you hear me?\n\nIRA FLATOW: Yes, go right ahead.\n\nSAMUEL: Hi I wanted to just say that I agree with what\u2019s been said, where we have a lot of very good image generators and chatbots. But those are pretty far away from something that can reason cognitively and generate new ideas. It\u2019s always kind of a\u2013 we\u2019re making amalgamations of things that are already on the internet. And the jump from that to\u2013 or kind of summarizing to generating something new, something that hasn\u2019t been done or said before, that\u2019s a leap that I think hasn\u2019t been made yet. And the trend I see is that tech companies can slap AI-powered on anything now, and it makes investors happy. But the results, the profitability of it, the advancements, it\u2019s hard to know what the scale actually will be of that, the impact of that.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Good point. Rumman?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Yeah, there was a report last year, I believe, or two years ago, that pretty much dug into all the companies claiming that their products were AI-powered. It was in the UK. And it found about 60% of them had no AI under the hood. First of all, we have a very slippery slope definition of AI itself. And then now it\u2019s translated into AGI.\n\nAnd again, to Will\u2019s point, the analogy I give is how we have gone down this same slippery slope of self-driving cars. Remember the earliest self-driving cars, and what we imagined is like we\u2019d get into this pod, and take a nap, and it whisked us off to where we\u2019re going?\n\nIRA FLATOW: Yeah, The Jetsons.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Right. But now, according to Elon Musk, we have self-driving cars, which we still have to sit there in traffic with our hands on 10 and 2 and our foot on the brake. And this car is, quote, unquote, \u201cdriving.\u201d But if it got into an accident, we are liable. So you\u2019re still effectively absorbing all the stress of driving with none of the self-driving.\n\nIRA FLATOW: But let\u2019s also go right to the main point that I see, is that the reason all AI exists and AGI is being developed, it\u2019s about the money.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: 100%.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Isn\u2019t it?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: It is. And actually, OpenAI and Microsoft have defined what AGI is with a monetary value. They have said it is when they have earned $200 billion of revenue. Then, they will slap on a sticker and say, we have AGI.\n\nIRA FLATOW: So do you agree, Will? It\u2019s about the money here?\n\nWILL HEAVEN: Yeah, I do. Yeah, it was like, I\u2019m happy that we were reminded of that definition. I think that\u2019s probably the best definition of AGI we have. At least it\u2019s precise and clear. But yeah, absolutely. It\u2019s so hard to talk about AI advances and really get into the details of what these systems can and can\u2019t do because the tech is being developed by companies.\n\nThey\u2019re doing it for profit. Obviously, they\u2019re going to make as big a claim for their new tech as they can. And again, genuinely, when you get a lot of these demos in your hands, they are truly impressive. But they\u2019re never going to be as impressive as the companies selling them want them to be.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: And the story within the story is that, for many years, companies have poached the brightest scientists and minds from academic institutions. In fact, they poached them straight out of their PhD programs. If you go visit the University of Cambridge, Oxford, MIT, Stanford, there\u2019s a very close tie to every single major model developer, and that\u2019s on purpose. So there is something also to be said here about the lack of independent researchers who are able to do this work without getting funding or just explicitly being hired by these companies.\n\nIRA FLATOW: We\u2019re talking about AI this hour on Science Friday, and we\u2019d like to get your calls. We\u2019re going to have to go to a break, but don\u2019t forget our number. 877-925-9174. Talking with Dr. Roman Chowdhury and also with Will Douglas Heaven. And we\u2019ll be right back after this short break. Stay with us.\n\nThis is Science Friday. I\u2019m Ira Flatow with Flora Lichtman. We\u2019re talking this hour about artificial general intelligence, systems as smart or maybe smarter than any person in any task, which is not here yet, but could be soon. And we want to hear from you. Our number is 877-925-9174. 877-925-9174. And let\u2019s go to the phones to Chris in Scottsdale, Arizona. Hi, Chris.\n\nCHRIS: Hey, Ira. Can you hear me?\n\nIRA FLATOW: I sure can. Go ahead.\n\nCHRIS: Excellent. Well, I was just going to mention that I use AI quite a bit for nutrition analysis. So it helps me come up with plans of what I\u2019m going to eat during the day. And I love it. One question about that that I would have\u2013 and it helps me with recipes too. But do they think the memory on these things is going to get better or we\u2019ll have personalized AI that can remember what we ate a month ago? Because what I find is, I have ChatGPT, and I\u2019ve tried Grok, and both of them forget. If you go back to it after a week, now you\u2019re having a brand new conversation.\n\nSo one thing would be about the memory. And I had just second question about what will happen with AI. Do you think it\u2019s\u2013 or do your experts think it\u2019s more likely that we\u2019ll have a situation where they\u2019ll replace the jobs loss from AI with universal basic income\u2013 something like that? Or do you think it would be something like an assisted situation, where all of our jobs are assisted. We tell AI what to do, and it does the job for us? So that\u2019s my two questions.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Two meaty questions, Chris. Thanks for calling. I\u2019m going to divide it up. Will, you want to take the first half of that?\n\nWILL HEAVEN: Sure. Yeah, the memory is a feature that a bunch of these companies making these chatbots have either already added or are talking about adding to the chatbot. I think it\u2019s something\u2013 an option that you can turn off or in ChatGPT, and probably in the others, like Gemini and Grok. So I don\u2019t know if\u2013 Chris, wasn\u2019t it\u2013 the caller is using that feature.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert on the actual different tiers, there are different paid tiers and free versions of these chatbots. But it\u2019s certainly something which exists in some of them. And if it doesn\u2019t already, then I know that\u2019s what people are aiming to improve, like this idea that, yeah, this will be your personal little buddy that knows more about you than anyone else and can recommend stuff is a vision.\n\nIRA FLATOW: And Rumman what about jobs? Is it taking our jobs?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Yeah, I also can chime in on the first one. I use Perplexity to help me do research. They actually have something called threads. And then a thread can be a particular topic, and you can go back to that. So not to promote any particular AI. It just happens to be the one that I use for that reason.\n\nFuture of work\u2013 I have many thoughts on future of work. Well, first of all, I want to start by saying there is no finite amount of work we do as humans. I think one of the fallacies of this \u201cthere will be no jobs\u201d conversation is there\u2019s a core assumption that is wrong\u2013 that there is a finite amount of work that we do. Any sort of technological advancement has actually not given us less work, but more work.\n\nHow much more available are we now that we can be found on these little devices, our phones, 24/7? We used to leave work at 5:00. Very few of us remember that time anymore. So email, internet did not give us less work. It actually gave us more things to do.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some empirical evidence to back this. So there\u2019s three studies I like to talk about. The very first one came out last year. It\u2019s by this labor economist, Dr. Daron Acemoglu, out of MIT,\u2013 like, brilliant labor economist. And he did a macroeconomic measure of the impact of AI over the next 10 years and found that total factor productivity\u2013 so all of the stuff we produce in the world\u2013 sub-1% will be automated by AI.\n\nBut that\u2019s not nothing. I mean, sub-1% of what the entire world produces is still something. And what he talks about that\u2019s kind of interesting\u2013 I think this is what captures the imagination\u2013 most automation tends to get rid of blue collar jobs or rote tasks. So email automated sending mail. But what is interesting in capturing our minds about AI is that it automates knowledge tasks, which we\u2019ve never had before.\n\nSo he talks about how the distribution between blue and white collar jobs is actually fairly even, slash, maybe even leading a bit more towards lower tier knowledge jobs. The second paper I\u2019d like to talk about is called GPT or GPTS. It came out in 2023. It was actually by some researchers at OpenAI, as well as some economists, talking about how different sectors\u2013 what may be automated? What threat is faced by different sectors? So it\u2019s going from big picture to industry level.\n\nAnd the rough takeaway would be roughly that 80% of jobs will see about 20% automated away, 20% of jobs will see about 80% automated away. And they were talking about jobs like paralegal, et cetera, so research type jobs, so knowledge jobs, which is interesting. The third one just came out last week. Really interesting, and this is getting super nitty gritty about future of work.\n\nHarvard Business School and some other folks worked with Procter Gamble. And they did this study across over 900 employees. They did kind of like a competition, where it was individual humans, individual human plus AI\u2013 like teams, teams plus AI. And they looked at things like quality of work, time to completion, how well it augmented people already with a skill set, and how well it augmented people without a skill set in a particular topic.\n\nIt\u2019s lots of details, but pretty much, the takeaway is that human plus AI is better than human alone is better than AI alone. So it\u2019s one of those things where it is a productivity booster. And what that means is probably what it has always meant for us when we\u2019ve gotten new productivity technology, which is that we will just have more stuff to do.\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: When we think about AI, we talk about it as a reflection of us, that it learns from us, it learns from our data. Can we teach AI to be better than us?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. I think AI is capable of evaluating data at a scale that is hard for humans to do. That\u2019s why the output of these models can be so impressive. So the short answer is yes. The longer, more complicated answer is what do you mean by better?\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: And I mean it specifically, like doesn\u2019t cheat, is more ethical. When people think about these sort of doomsday scenarios with AI, they\u2019re like, oh, AI is going to scheme and take down humanity. Can you teach AI ethics?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: The short answer is yes. And actually, a lot of these scenarios where AI, quote, unquote, \u201ccheats,\u201d it has no normative judgment. It doesn\u2019t understand good and bad. So even predating GenAI, I remember some of the earliest models coming out of DeepMind and some of the research bodies, they would play video games. And it would do things like race a car backwards, or it would shoot everybody else in the game and then pick up all the goodies.\n\nBut that is not the AI being evil. We have decided that is evil because we made rules. And we implicitly know, if I\u2019m playing a game with other people, what I should not do is get rid of everybody else so I can slowly pick up all the goodies. The AI is simply optimizing for what you have told it to do, like in this very blunt way.\n\nIf you are of a particular age and I am of a particular age, and you read like Amelia Bedelia as a kid, think of it as Amelia Bedelia. You literally are like\u2013 I don\u2019t know\u2013 make me a cake. And it will just quite literally\u2013\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: Very literal. Yeah.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: \u2013yes. And a lot of these issues of AI gone awry, it actually can be boiled down to a misspecified objective function. You are telling it to do something. You actually have to think through all the ways in which you are making assumptions, because you have been socialized to do things a certain way. And like, how would Amelia Bedelia understand this?\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: That\u2019s going to be the new way that I interact with GPT.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Let\u2019s go to the phones to Anton in Phoenix. Hi, Anton. Welcome to Science Friday.\n\nANTON: Hey, there. Thank you. Can you hear me OK?\n\nIRA FLATOW: Sure.\n\nANTON: Yeah, so I just wanted to address the earlier question that you guys asked Gemini, which is if there\u2019s one thing that you would want to focus humanity on, what would it be? And I\u2019m thinking about\u2013 like, somebody said doomsday scenario. And oftentimes, when we talk about doomsday scenarios, we\u2019re thinking about the technology getting smarter than us, and then deciding that we\u2019re expendable, and all of that.\n\nBut I think that\u2019s kind of misguided. It makes for a good science fiction novel, but I think the problem\u2013 if that was the problem, then it would be a technology problem. That would be easy. The problem I see is a people problem. So the NRA says guns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people. And I think we really need to focus on maybe two things.\n\nOne is, who\u2019s controlling the AI, both in terms of training it as well as using it to inference to actually do things? But I think the bigger thing is really, if you think about artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence, where it has\u2013 whatever\u2013 godlike intelligence, an AI is not going to necessarily see humans as a threat unless humans are competing for the same resources with the AI. So that could be jobs. It could be electricity. It could be any number of things.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s\u2013 the question that I think about is, how do we arrive at a place where AI isn\u2019t being manipulated by humans for human ends?\n\nIRA FLATOW: Yeah, OK.\n\nANTON: And just so one example. OK, go ahead. Yep.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. Let me get an answer to it because\u2013 I mean, if the point of AI is to make money, it\u2019s going to be manipulated to make money.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: I mean, it already is. If we think about where money is being spent to build AI capabilities, companies have conveniently found the alignment of things people are willing to spend money on, cross, things that are also important to us. It\u2019s not surprising that health care has been one of the primary applications. There\u2019s so much money to be made in health care.\n\nBut also we want to lead better lives. The other one people talk about quite a bit is education. But no one no one is talking about things that are maybe less profitable but also good for humanity. And I appreciate the statement about, let\u2019s think about the access or the people behind the wheel. A lot of these doomsday scenarios are very fantastical. What if AI sets off nuclear weapons? Why the hell did you give AI access to be able to set off\u2013 (CHUCKLING) you can just not do that.\n\nIRA FLATOW: For those of people who worry about the singularity\u2013 I mean, when AI is smarter than us and takes\u2013 we become subservient.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: I mean, I think most AI is smarter than me from an ability to answer Jeopardy questions perspective. I probably couldn\u2019t beat the average AI system.\n\nWILL HEAVEN: Can I jump in on that?\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: Yes, please.\n\nWILL HEAVEN: What gets me about all these doomsday scenarios is this weird sense of inevitability that this technology is just going to appear and squash us puny humans. We don\u2019t have to make this. We don\u2019t have to make it have the nuclear codes, as you said. We don\u2019t have to make it so that it has any power over us at all.\n\nIRA FLATOW: But we also already have some advances in medicine, where doctors are doing things doctors couldn\u2019t do. Aren\u2019t there already positive results, Will, of using AI?\n\nWILL HEAVEN: Oh, yeah\u2013 many. And medicine is a great example. I mean, just the everyday conveniences that we\u2019re already seeing from chatbots, I think, are great. So I don\u2019t want to come\u2013 in these conversations where we go straight to AGI, I come across as sort of a naysaying crank, which is not a good professional look for someone who is very much, and has been for more than a decade, a champion of this technology, which I think is amazing. It just gets derailed. I think a lot of the interesting, brilliant things that we could talk about get derailed when we talk about doomsday scenarios\u2013\n\nFLORA LICHTMAN: Well, what are they? What are the interesting things that we should be talking about?\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: I can chime in on some of that. I mean, we are likely to cure many cancers in our lifetime because of the advanced protein folding AI-driven technologies that have been created. This is a fact. We have advances in genomics and medicine because of the models that have been made there.\n\nWe have better weather prediction models. And I live part time in Texas, and hurricanes are a very big deal. We have better weather prediction models that can tell us weeks in advance that a hurricane may be coming because of AI. And the thing is this just won\u2019t capture the imagination the way a, quote, unquote, \u201ctalking humanoid bot\u201d idea will. But all of that is AI. As Will is saying, it\u2019s a disservice to have such a focus driven by multiple narratives, companies included, to push us to look at AGI when we actually can celebrate a lot of the great stuff that AI is being used for today.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Let\u2019s go to the phones to Marlena in Washington State. Hi, there. Welcome to Science Friday.\n\nMARLENA: Hi, can you hear me.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Yes, I can.\n\nMARLENA: OK. My question is, what is AI going to do to stop sucking up all the electricity in our environment? I live in a small rural town. And a small rural town really close to ours has made a deal, and they\u2019ve built a big data center. And we all know this is how AI generates all its juice.\n\nAnd it made a deal with this town waiving the employment flag. And now, these residents in this small town are experiencing rolling blackouts. I call this predatory behavior. And I would like to know what AI\u2013 what these billionaire owners of AI are going to do to be protective of people and save more of the energy in our environment? I mean, come on. This is global warming, people.\n\nIRA FLATOW: Sounds like Marlena\u2019s mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Will, what do you say to that? Good point?\n\nWILL HEAVEN: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a really good point, especially if you had this affecting your neighborhood. I think we are going to see that. These massive data centers get set up, and they suck the power out of the local grid. So there\u2019s lots of things that could be done.\n\nAnd let\u2019s let that hang in the air for a minute. There\u2019s a lot of work being done to reduce the size of models. And a smaller model can do many of the things that a larger model can do for less power. There are things that could be done around the way that these models are trained\u2013 train them more efficiently.\n\nRather than just throw every single bit of data you can scrape up at them, maybe curate that data and show them data that\u2019s actually going to be more useful. So the training steps could be fewer, again, using less electricity. That\u2019s all on the side of actually building the models. The data centers, of course, are used then to run the models.\n\nWe\u2019re all invoking ChatGPT for our recipes and everything else. And every time we do that, it\u2019s sucking up a lot of power. So I mean, we could be making more efficient chips. We could be running on renewable sources of energy and finding ways to store that energy in the data centers with batteries, et cetera. So all of which is just to say there are solutions available.\n\nWill they happen is a completely different question, because right now, this is a race to the bottom. All these companies really, really having invested everything they have into this race need to come out on top with the punchiest most powerful AI model. And I think the sustainability needs are going to be an afterthought.\n\nIRA FLATOW: 30 seconds to go, Rumman.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Well, Microsoft is rebooting Three Mile Island for those who are local, who know what that is.\n\nIRA FLATOW: I remember it well.\n\nRUMMAN CHOWDHURY: Yes. And when pressed on this, Sam Altman was sort of hand-waving over, we should have fission technology in our lifetimes and everything will be fine. So it seems like they too are banking on scientific advancements to do the work for them.\n\nIRA FLATOW: We\u2019ve run out of time. I\u2019d like to thank my guests\u2013 Will Douglas Heaven, senior editor for AI coverage at MIT Technology Review, and Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, founder and CEO of Parity Consulting and the responsible AI fellow at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard. Thank you both for taking time to be with us today.",

      "text": "US stocks opened in the red on Wednesday morning after the Commerce Department unveiled new restrictions on popular chip exports to China \u2013 and Nvidia warned it could cost the chipmaker billions of dollars.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 194 points, or 0.5%, shortly after the regular trading session began at 9:30 a.m ET.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 0.9% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nThe Commerce Department announced on Tuesday that it was mandating new licensing requirements for Nvidia and AMD to export popular chips to China.\n\nNvidia said it would be hit with $5.5 billion in charges due to the new regulations, which would limit exports of its popular H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, one of its key markets.\n\nShares in Nvidia and AMD plunged 5.5% and 6.3%, respectively, on Wednesday morning.\n\nStocks had been on a rebound after a volatile week of trading, as President Trump\u2019s back-and-forth on tariffs \u2014 unveiling stiff taxes and then pausing them for 90 days \u2014 spooked investors.\n\nThe White House has imposed a hefty 145% tax on goods from China, and temporarily lowered all other rates to 10% as the administration holds negotiations with several nations.\n\nThe stricter rules on semiconductors are just the latest move from US officials to keep advanced chips from making their way to China to prevent the nation from building powerful supercomputers and edging ahead in the AI race.\n\n\u201cThe Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President\u2019s directive to safeguard our national and economic security,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said in a statement.\n\nChinese companies, including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, had been ramping up their orders for Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to keep up with demand for low-cost AI models after DeepSeek\u2019s roaring debut, according to a Reuters report.\n\nNvidia was reportedly made aware of the incoming export rules last week, but did not warn some of its major customers in advance, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nNvidia declined to comment.\n\nThe loss of these customers could significantly hammer Nvidia\u2019s business, which had secured $18 billion worth of H20 orders since the start of the year, according to the report.\n\nNvidia\u2019s H20 is the main chip it is legally allowed to sell to Chinese customers. Since 2022, the company has faced increasingly strict restrictions as the US fears advanced chips could help China advance its military power.\n\nThe latest chip export curbs could push Chinese firms to purchase chips from local competitors, like Huawei.\n\nCosts for chipmakers in the US, meanwhile, are expected to soar due to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe new taxes could cost semiconductor equipment makers more than $1 billion a year, according to industry calculations discussed with White House officials, per a Reuters report.\n\nThe three largest US chip equipment manufacturers \u2013 Applied Materials, Lam Research and KLA \u2013 may lose roughly $350 million each per year, sources said.\n\nSmaller rivals could also be slapped with tens of millions of dollars in additional costs.\n\nWith Post wires",

      "title": "The religion of AI",
      "text": "Earlier this year, hundreds of chief executives and civil society leaders joined over 60 heads of state who gathered in the Swiss enclave of Davos for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. This year the theme was \u201cCollaboration for the Intelligent Age,\u201d and while the speeches of anti-globalist figures like Argentinian President Javier Milei and President Donald Trump might have been the most watched aspects of the meeting, there was something far more unexpected that took place. The Davos leadership convened an unusual group for the first time. They invited a handful of global religious leaders as full participants in the annual meeting, and among the three urgent issues they were asked to focus on was rebuilding trust in the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nThis is because the age of artificial intelligence is emerging at a moment when religion itself is on the ascendancy on multiple fronts throughout the entire world. According to Pew Research, by 2050 only 13 percent of the world will be religiously unaffiliated. This is happening at a time in which religious affiliation is growing the most in countries where the population is increasing, amid a prevailing global trend of declining fertility rates.\n\nEverywhere one looks, even in the United States, religious forces are rising. Take the decades-long trend of America\u2019s young people identifying as \u201cnone\u201d when asked about their religious affiliation. This was a trend so solidly entrenched by demographers that it was taken for granted, but in recent surveys we\u2019ve seen a stabilization of the trend and then a decline in the so-called \u201cnone\u201d affiliation. Another survey recently found that young men are now more religious than young women and Bible sales rose by 22 percent in a single year, according to The Wall Street Journal. Religiously charged political debates are transforming the European continent, religiously inflamed wars ravage the Middle East, and religiously infused politics animates India and Africa. Religious persecution continues to be at its highest in the world\u2019s most authoritarian regimes, from North Korea to the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nReligion is on the rise amid the emergence of artificial intelligence, a phenomenon that some are calling the single most significant technological innovation since the printing press, but certainly since the industrial revolution \u2014 both of which were followed by terrible periods of conflict.\n\nThe age of artificial intelligence is causing a kind of convergence of religion and science that was once inconceivable. One might even say a \u201cpeace treaty between religion and science\u201d is emerging. The peace between the two old nemeses has emerged because scientific advance has brought us to the place where questions once reserved for theologians and philosophers are now factors in equations that absolutely must be solved: What is intelligence? What is agency? What can be done versus what should be done? What is a human? Do the ends justify the means or should the greater good always prevail? What is appropriate for all humans versus some?\n\nThis moment has brought to the fore a simple fact, and an inconvenient one for many universities and tech entrepreneurs: One doesn\u2019t have to be religious to acknowledge religion\u2019s values. In fact, a totally secular person can appreciate that religious ideas are a type of compounding wisdom over the centuries.\n\nWe have rarely needed wisdom more than we will need it now.\n\nA religious zeal\n\nIt isn\u2019t that some of our scientists, and the universities and companies they lead, aren\u2019t religious. In fact, you might argue that while not being institutionally religious, they are profoundly religious when it comes to their commitment to ideologies that guide how they engage in this age of intelligence.\n\nIn \u201cThe Digitalist Papers\u201d published by Stanford University last year, I argued alongside co-authors E. Glen Weyl and Mona Hamdy that two ideological frameworks have emerged that are dominating the way most view this new age of intelligence: libertarianism and technocracy. Each ideology, functioning like a secular religion, has its own clearly defined ideas \u2014 you might call it theology \u2014 that define rules of engagement for artificial intelligence. When popular venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen published his so-called \u201cTechno-Optimist Manifesto,\u201d he ironically used the phrase \u201cwe believe\u201d no less than 100 times as he strived to convince the world that artificial intelligence should be given the permission it needs to transform our world and the people who live in it.\n\nThe tools that can emerge from the age of intelligence should be transformative for communities of faith.\n\nThe libertarians \u201cbelieve\u201d in maximal freedom for AI developers, and the technocrats \u201cbelieve\u201d they deserve deity-like powers that will be confined to a small regulatory class tasked with managing the outcomes for the rest of us. In either case, traditional religious concepts warn us these are dangerous ideas. For the libertarians, religious wisdom asks whether human beings are designed for absolute freedom or whether we need community to provide meaning and infrastructure for life. Similar religious ideas challenge the centralization sought by the technocrats because it risks exacerbating class divides that defy the equal dignity of all humans even as the technocrats brazenly confront ancient warnings about the implications of men who enjoy playing God.\n\nWhen the forces of technocracy demand the consolidation of authority over AI, to protect us from ourselves, religious wisdom warns against the corrupting power of those who aspire to God-like power, making idols of themselves. When libertarians or technocrats imagine a world where AI makes work, governance and suffering optional, religious wisdom warns against the lessons unlearned by those denied the opportunity to work or to struggle at some point in their lives.\n\nThe intelligent age is emerging at a time when our research universities, along with Silicon Valley, have little exposure to religious concepts. So, it seems they have made their own religions often built on the foundation alone of maximizing profit or power.\n\nA tool for faith leaders\n\nIt isn\u2019t just much-needed wisdom that religion brings to AI but also a vast multibillion-person market for tools that can contribute to community building. If one wants to build or strengthen communities worldwide, for example, then the best place to start is often a place of worship (or a school).\n\nThe tools that can emerge from the age of intelligence should be transformative for communities of faith and for the promotion of values that they share; values which aim alone to build healthy communities and bring compassion to a cruel, unforgiving world.\n\nAs a simple example, take the perfunctory challenges of clergy or laypeople who are tasked with ministering to large communities, often spanning multiple generations with various, sometimes intermittent levels of commitment to their communities of faith.\n\nMillions of Christians identify a particular congregation as their \u201chome church\u201d while only actually attending it on Christmas or Easter. Similarly, many Muslims have a local mosque that they attend mainly during festivals like Ramadan. Other communities of faith, like Buddhists or Hindus, may not be linked to individual places of worship at all, but they are connected to one another by theological or philosophical religious rituals that they can practice at any temple. Catholic bishops are often responsible for multiple congregations and schools, and sometimes across many different geographic regions. Then there\u2019s the post-pandemic trend of digital church, where millions of people who call a local congregation their home church also worship regularly online at another congregation, which can be anywhere in the world.\n\nIn all of these cases, the age of intelligence presents new opportunities to better connect communities of faith while also deepening those connections. Now, if a congregant loses a loved one, the ability of the congregation\u2019s care team to know it happened at all is based largely upon chance, notification by the family or simply word of mouth. Pastoral care in the age of intelligence can involve a pastor or counselor or life coach arriving at their office every day to a dashboard that has curated relevant data about individual congregants based upon tools the congregants have opted into. The counselor might discover that someone\u2019s grandfather passed away in another state or that a college student studying abroad is posting unusually depressive or out-of-character language on social media. They could see that a member of the congregation received a promotion at work on LinkedIn or lost their job or split from their partner or spouse. These life alerts might prompt the pastor to send an unsolicited note of encouragement or congratulations or to call someone who appears in need.\n\nCorporate boards and universities need to find faith again before the age of intelligence leaves us all to contend with whatever it has decided to create.\n\nImagine what it will mean to the cohesion of communities, when it\u2019s far harder for individuals \u2014 especially those who need connection the most \u2014 to fall through the cracks. Imagine what it will mean for the health of a community when every member of a community is given the opportunity for equal care and attention or is given an individualized plan for their development based upon a custom analysis of their spiritual need. The same tools can be used by schools or clubs or other anchors of civil society, and those tools can also be curated on an enterprise level to provide an assessment of a community on a quarterly or annual basis. This can help determine what programs or teachings are benefiting the congregation.\n\nArtificial intelligence will not just be a tool for the care of religious congregations. It is a veritable superpower to advance other concerns of virtually all religious communities to improve the world. There is no limit to what AI will mean for health care, for instance. We may finally find a cure for cancer and many other debilitating diseases. We will have tools to identify future life-altering diseases earlier than ever. AI can bring equity to health care quality, allowing those in the most far-flung places of the world to receive the same expert care as those living within a stone\u2019s throw of a top research hospital.\n\nThe age of intelligence will also make one-size-fits-all approaches to all kinds of global humanitarian problems obsolete. Currently, all developed nations provide a certain amount of humanitarian assistance to the world\u2019s most desperate people, but volumes can be written about how such aid is wasted or has unintended consequences. Some aid policies have flooded traditional communities with food that they might have otherwise grown. Other approaches have arbitrarily applied agricultural or other techniques hewn in different climates or cultures to environments where they were alien to begin with. With AI, volumes of data related to agriculture, climate or other unique economic factors can be analyzed in order to produce cost-effective solutions that maximize the return on investment of a country or NGO\u2019s efforts to provide humanitarian assistance.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the relevance of AI to conflict resolution and peacemaking.\n\nAt present, the world is inflicted with more active conflicts than at any time since World War II, according to the Global Peace Index. Resolution to these conflicts is often confined to the imagination of whomever is in charge at the moment. However, in the age of intelligence, our digital tools can provide to policymakers, heads of state or others a seemingly limitless array of possible solutions to the most intractable problems, drawing from a total command of all historical and other relevant knowledge. The system can also be made more immune to politics or the influence of ego or other personality factors. Leading up to the historic Abraham Accords, a document commissioned by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa of Bahrain began with these words: \u201cIgnorance is the enemy of peace.\u201d The king was right.\n\nThen, of course, most of the terrible, black swan events that have afflicted our world have often been similarly attributed to a \u201clack of imagination.\u201d The age of intelligence will give us all the imagination we could possibly need to make peace or to prepare for the worst.\n\nA guiding hand\n\nWhen religion has entered the AI conversation, it has often come at the heels of almost conspiratorial warnings about the potential apocalyptic implications of this new technology.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a place for those types of warnings in the age of intelligence, and we do not want AI technology to assume a God-like power over human agency. There is virtually no scenario where this would create anything but blinking red lights for the world.\n\nThe apocalyptic scenarios in this case are terrifying, especially since great technological revolutions have almost always brought new weapons of war. This is particularly perilous in a multipolar but interconnected world, where not all countries either enshrine or enforce laws that honor the equal dignity of all humans. The age of intelligence means an age where drone-first warfare could create millions of small weapons that can be fully autonomous and optimized only to kill. AI can give us rapidly produced, customized vaccines or antibiotics, but it can also allow nefarious actors to create customized biological weapons that can be tailor-made to kill whomever the designer determines is an enemy or undesirable (imagine a microscopic biological weapon flown on the tip of a fly-sized drone).\n\nScientists are profoundly religious in their commitment to ideologies that guide how they engage in this age of intelligence.\n\nThere are risks that require moral leaders to demand our political leaders protect us. We want AI to give us new tools to improve the world, maximizing the potential of this technology, but we want those tools always under human control.\n\nAt the same time, these religious warnings mustn\u2019t devolve into \u201cthe world is flat\u201d pronouncements. No, they would provide a guiding hand, and sometimes a gut check, to those who are leading us into this profound new period of human history.\n\nSimply put: Corporate boards and universities need to find faith again, for their own good, before the age of intelligence leaves us all to contend with whatever it has decided to create for us based upon how we designed it.\n\n\u201cEverything is permissible,\u201d scripture wisely warns, \u201cbut not everything is beneficial.\u201d\n\nJohnnie Moore is a contributing author of The Digitalist Papers, a project of Stanford University\u2019s Digital Economy Lab.

      "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul has announced a $5 million investment to establish Departments of AI and Society across eight State University of New York (SUNY) campuses. The initiative marks a major step in ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI) research in New York State promotes public good, ethical innovation, and inclusive collaboration.\n\n\u201cThis is about more than preparing students for the future of AI,\u201d said Hochul. \u201cWe\u2019re shaping how AI serves society \u2014 making sure it strengthens communities and supports our economy.\u201d\n\nEight SUNY Campuses to Host New AI and Society Programs\n\nFunding will support the creation or expansion of AI-focused departments, institutes, and research centers at:\n\nUniversity at Albany \u2013 AI & Society College & Research Center\n\nBinghamton University \u2013 Institute for AI and Society\n\nUniversity at Buffalo \u2013 Department of AI and Society\n\nSUNY Downstate \u2013 Global Center for AI, Society and Mental Health\n\nSUNY ESF \u2013 Center for AI, Society, and the Environment\n\nSUNY Poly \u2013 Institute for AI and Society\n\nStony Brook University \u2013 Department of Technology, AI and Society\n\nUpstate Medical \u2013 AHEAD Center (AI for Health Equity, Analytics, and Diagnostics)\n\nThese institutions will explore how AI intersects with mental health, climate science, ethics, and public health. Many projects will also include community partnerships and interdisciplinary student training.\n\nEmpire AI Expands at University at Buffalo\n\nHochul also highlighted early success from Empire AI Alpha, the first phase of a statewide computing hub housed at the University at Buffalo. Empire AI brings together researchers from SUNY campuses, CUNY, and private institutions like Cornell, NYU, Columbia, and RPI to collaborate on public-interest AI research.\n\nCurrent projects include:\n\nA UB-led initiative to create AI-driven diagnostics for every disease\n\nBinghamton\u2019s research into large language models and online antisemitism\n\nStony Brook\u2019s work on vaccine development using AI-powered antigen design\n\nTeaching Students, Protecting Society\n\nTo further embed AI across disciplines, SUNY has added artificial intelligence to its General Education Framework under Information Literacy.

      "title": "State Efficiency Bill Involving AI Advances in North Carolina",
      "text": "(TNS) \u2014 A N.C. Senate bill that would review state agency performance and staffing levels, relying in part on the use of artificial intelligence, cleared its first committee step Wednesday.\n\nSenate Bill 474, titled \u201cThe DAVE Act,\u201d was recommended by the Senate Regulatory Reform committee after nearly 30 minutes of at times contentious debate.\n\nAlthough the bill is being fast-tracked to gatekeeper Rules and Operations committee, the legislation is expected to be inserted into the 2025-26 state budget bill to fund additional state Auditor office job positions.\n\nSenate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, is in the rare role of being a primary bill sponsor.\n\nAccording to a news release from Berger\u2019s office, the legislation is designed to \u201cget a complete picture\u201d of how state agencies are utilizing taxpayer funds \u201cand determine if the agency should continue to exist.\u201d\n\nThe acronym DAVE stands for Division of Accountability, Value and Efficiency, which would be housed in the State Auditor\u2019s office of Republican Dave Boliek.\n\nBill sponsors say the key areas for state agency review \u2014 so far \u2014 includes: amounts spent, including the entities receiving funds and the intended purpose of the amounts spent; effectiveness of any amount spent in achieving the intended purpose of that spending; and duplicative spending.\n\nEach agency is to report all job positions that have been vacant for six months or more. Agency reports would have an Oct. 1 filing deadline.\n\nSB474 was amended to establish a sunset that was not specified, but to occur after the 2028 general election, and allow Boliek to request annual reports.\n\nBerger said SB474 \u201cfacilitates the auditor\u2019s ability to move forward on examining how monies that are appropriated by the General Assembly ... are actually deployed ... effectively deployed and whether or not there\u2019s a failure on the part of an executive agency to utilize the funds as directed by the legislature.\u201d\n\nThe bill is likely to join the growing list of Republican-sponsored bills that may serve as the first test of Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s ability to sustain a veto vote.\n\nSenate Republicans hold a 30-20 supermajority that gives them the votes to override a Stein veto. However, House Republicans are one vote shy of a supermajority at 71-49.\n\nBoliek, in his first term as auditor, said SB474 empowers the state Auditor\u2019s Office \u201cto do that what we already have the authority to do\u201d in terms of auditing for operational, funding and overall program efficiency.\u201d\n\nBoliek said the proposed objectives of SB474 should draw bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cWhat this bill does is it puts together the legislature, the executive branch and the state Auditor\u2019s Office,\u201d Boliek said.\n\n\u201cIt is designed to do better government, a date-centered approach that gets real, impactful results.\u201d\n\nBoliek claimed SB474 is needed in part because previous state auditors provided \u201cbread and butter financial audits that are a 30,000-foot views that does not \u2014 quite frankly \u2014 give members of this body the type of information you need and you expect ... to make competent, judgmental decisions as they run their agencies.\n\n\u201cMy commitment is to do this in a nonpartisan way that\u2019s data centric. ... not emotion. The proof will be in the pudding.\u201d\n\nBoliek said the expanded use of artificial intelligence is warranted \u201cbecause we\u2019ve got to start somewhere in the state of North Carolina because it\u2019s coming, and there\u2019s no better place than the state Auditor\u2019s Office to get started with that.\u201d\n\nSeveral Senate Democratic committee members critical of SB474 claimed Senate GOP leaders want to establish a N.C. version of the controversial federal DOGE initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThey expressed concerns that state departments and agencies, already are dealing with staffing vacancies reaching 20% to 25%, could have their workforce experience more cuts based on assessments from artificial intelligence algorithms.\n\nSen. Caleb Theodros, D-Mecklenburg, said there needs to be firm restraints and transparency on the use of artificial intelligence in evaluating the performance of agencies and their employees.\n\nBerger said legislators will employ artificial intelligence as a tool in determining funding appropriation levels and whether state funds are being wasted or not.\n\n\u201cYour comments point out exactly why we need something like this,\u201d Berger said.\n\nSen. Lisa Grafstein, D-Wake, said the auditor\u2019s office focuses on accounting functions, and is not meant to be a program evaluator of the work of state employees and \u201cwhether they are necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we are getting really close to the idea that we\u2019re demonizing state employees who are trying to do their jobs, and folks who are trying to make our communities better.\u201d\n\nSen. Sophia Chitlik, D-Durham, said moving forward with SB474 is harmful when state government is struggling to fill about 14,000 job vacancies, in part because of the pay scale compared with the private sector.\n\n\u201cBehind every one of these jobs there is a reason for them, a community need,\u201d Chitlik said.\n\n\u201cIt strikes me as actually very inefficient to potentially leave it up to AI to eliminate them because we can\u2019t fill them.\u201d\n\nChitlik said the DOGE initiative is putting about 35,000 federal jobs in N.C. at risk of elimination.\n\nShe cited as an example the elimination of a UNC Health laboratory workforce dedicated to studying youth vaping \u201cbecause their NIH (National Institutes of Health) grant had the word equity in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not need to look any further than our state for examples of what happens when you let an algorithm take control of our workplace,\u201d she said.\n\nBerger responded by saying Boliek \u201chas no authority to discharge anyone. He has the authority to identify problems in any discharge.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny elimination of positions would be left up to the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nSen. Woodson Bradley, D-Mecklenburg, said it is critical that whatever authority that DAVE is given by the legislature has bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let this infect the entire (state) budget, not let it hurt people with zero accountability,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, public speakers called out Senate Republican leadership for what they termed hypocrisy.\n\nThey said the call for more stringent evaluations of how government agencies operate runs counter to legislators sticking into the 2023 state budget bill language that allows legislators to determine whether documents are public records, shield them from public release and destroy them if they choose.\n\n\u00a9 2025 the News & Record (Greensboro, N.C.).

      "title": "Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq slide as Nvidia's dive weighs on tech",
      "text": "US stocks fell on Wednesday after Nvidia (NVDA) revealed costly new curbs on chip exports to China, and investors grappled with uncertainty over President Trump's trade policy.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped more than 1.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed more than 300 points, or around 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell over 2.3% as the new chip provisions weighed on the tech sector.\n\nNvidia's stock took a hit early, falling more than 5% after the company revealed that the US government has imposed new restrictions on its chips.\n\nA new filing from Nvidia on Tuesday showed that the US government has required licenses for exports to China of the company's H20 artificial intelligence chip. The chip giant said the move would result in $5.5 billion in charges. A similar filing from AMD said the company expects to incur costs up to $800 million from the new export controls, prompting shares to dive 6%.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs on key imports remain up in the air. Exemptions from auto duties are reportedly under consideration, while the ultimate fate of recently paused tariffs on consumer electronics is unknown.

      "text": "TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shares in Asian tech companies that are major suppliers to companies like Apple rose on Monday after the U.S. government granted temporary exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.\n\nShares in Foxconn, Apple's largest iPhone assembler, rose as much as 7.8% before trimming gains to close 3% higher. Contract laptop maker Quanta closed up 5.8% and Inventec - which also makes artificial intelligence servers - rose 4.1%.\n\nThe broad index closed 0.1% lower\n\nChina's Goertek and Lens Tech both rose by more than 7% before also trimming gains. Both firms are Apple suppliers.\n\nShares in South Korea's Samsung Electronics, which supplies Apple and is also the second-ranked smartphone vendor in the U.S. market, were up 1.5%.\n\n\"We view the dizzying weekend tariff news as a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names as it gives some flexibility and allows for China negotiations to hopefully take place in the coming months,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note.\n\nAnalysts have warned that U.S. prices of iPhones could surge, given Apple's high reliance on imports from China. Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the U.S. from India, Reuters reported last week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on social media on Sunday the electronics products excluded from his reciprocal tariffs \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket,\" and would be reviewed along with semiconductors in a national security trade investigation into the sector.\n\nExecutives in the electronics sector lamented the Trump administration's regular policy shifts.\n\nRenaud Anjoran, a partner of Agilian, a contract manufacturer of electronics in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Dongguan, said keeping up with the changes was \"exhausting\".\n\n\"All the customers are basically in panic mode and everybody's busy just following up and reading the news, and contacting and talking to people but no decisions, a lot of things are on hold, that's the situation now,\" he said.\n\nA Taiwanese electronic company executive said the uncertainty was unsettling and it was unclear if the tariff exemptions announced by the U.S. were real or \"just talk\".\n\nThe executive declined to be named as he was not permitted to speak to media.\n\nShares of some chipmakers bucked the trend, after Trump said on Air Force One that he would announce a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, though he added there would be flexibility on some companies in the sector.\n\nShares in TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, closed 2.7% lower despite having opened higher, while memory chipmaker SK Hynix fell 0.5%.\n\nAlex Huang, vice president of Mega International Investment Services, said the market on Monday morning was reacting to Trump's exemption announcement, but the reaction may be too early as details are still to come out.\n\n\"It's impossible that semiconductors will be exempt from the tariffs, as that would eliminate the need for any bargaining chips in talks with the United States,\" he added.\n\nTSMC is due to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Additional reporting by Emily Chan; Writing by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

      "title": "Sudan's war is 2 years in and shows no signs of slowing, as talks take place",
      "text": "LONDON \u2014 Foreign ministers from 20 countries are meeting in London Tuesday as part of a diplomatic effort to restart stalled peace talks over Sudan's civil war that began two years ago. The United Nations says the conflict has prompted the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and the most devastating famine in decades.\n\nDespite the war's unprecedented impact, with as many as 150,000 people dead, and almost a third of the country's pre-war population displaced, there has been little concerted international action to address the crisis.\n\nThe U.K., France and Germany are cohosting Wednesday's conference, but have not invited either of the warring factions themselves; the Sudanese Armed Forces \u2014 widely considered to be the de-facto government \u2014 and its erstwhile paramilitary partners, known as the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 or RSF.\n\nBoth forces cooperated to launch a coup against the country's fledgling civilian-led government in 2021. Civilian rule had emerged after the fall of longtime autocrat, Omar al-Bashir, who was deposed during a 2019 revolution that stunned the region. Sudan's Armed Forces had become the senior partner in a new transitional government, before tensions between the Armed Forces and the RSF ignited a full-blown war in April 2023.\n\nSudanese officials have expressed anger they were not invited to the talks, as well as frustration at the inclusion of countries that many consider responsible for fanning and fueling the conflict. There is mounting evidence, for instance, that the United Arab Emirates have been arming the Rapid Support Forces, which stand accused of perpetrating genocidal acts against African ethnic groups in Darfur. The RSF has also been accused of carrying out other atrocities during the war, including the systematic use of sexual violence, the targeting of medical facilities, and persistent looting in communities that have fallen under their control.\n\nLast week Sudan's military led government initiated a case against the UAE at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which it accused the Arab nation of being complicit in a genocide against African ethnic groups, perpetrated by the RSF and several allied Arab militias.\n\nWhile rights groups have accused both sides of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings and the blocking of humanitarian aid, they have blamed the vast majority of atrocities on the RSF.The U.S., U.N. and several rights groups have meanwhile also said the RSF committed acts of genocide during the war, largely against groups of ethnic Masalits, Zagawas and Furs in Darfur. The last genocide in Darfur took place more than 20 years ago, and was carried out by a militia group called the \"Janjaweed,\" that became globally infamous. Members of the group have, in part, evolved to become the RSF.\n\nLast month the Sudanese army regained control of the capital city Khartoum from the RSF. But while the gradual reconstruction of that shattered city begins, the fighting in the west of the country has intensified.\n\nOver the past week, the RSF intensified its months-long siege on the city of El Fasher in the Western region of Darfur. It is the last Darfuri city that the group does not yet control. The attacks have caused international outrage, with more than 320 people already killed, according to a local grassroots support network called Emergency Response Rooms.\n\nThe group said most of those deaths occurred inside two aid camps. One of them, called Zamzam, is the largest displacement camp in Sudan and had hosted more than half a million people, with a famine inside the camp declared last year. The U.N. recently said between 60,000 to 80,000 households in the camp had been displaced by the recent fighting and had fled into the center of El Fasher, or the surrounding desert.\n\nA resident from El Fasher, who asked not to be named, told NPR the situation was \"extremely difficult,\" and said hundreds of thousands of those displaced from the Zamzam camp were now crammed into the city's streets. \"Right now, even in my own house there are more than 100 women and children,\" said the resident, adding that those still out on the streets are surviving \"without water, without food, without health services \u2014 and unfortunately no one is asking about them, no one is taking care of them.\"\n\n\"The situation is very bad, it's suffering,\" the resident said. \"Not just suffering, torture.\"\n\nMost of Zamzam's residents had sought refuge in the camp during the last major conflict to wrack Darfur back in 2003, having been driven from their homes by the Janjaweed militia group.\n\nSatellite footage analyzed by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab showed evidence of the RSF's attack on the Zamzam. Images indicated that more than 200 armed pick-up trucks, known as \"technicals\" had swarmed the camp between April 11 and April 14, and the camp's main market had been torched to the ground during that period.\n\n\" At this point, the RSF has faced no significant consequences for mass atrocities, tantamount to genocide,\" said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of that Yale research team. \"If they are left alone without any international interdiction, they will be fundamentally in position to complete the slaughter of non-Arab black African civilians from the Zagawa, the Fur and the Masalit, who have sought shelter for 20 years in El Fasher and Zamzam.\"\n\nOn Sunday an RSF spokesperson, Al Fatih Qurashi, said the RSF had taken over the camp, and said it had harbored fighters aligned with the Sudanese Armed Forces. Widespread reports by local rights groups detailed some of the worst atrocities perpetrated during the current war had occurred inside the camp. These included the rounding up and executing of refugees, as well as aid workers from an aid group called Relief International.\n\nThe paramilitary group denied killing any civilians, but Relief International, which operated the only remaining medical facility in the camp, said members of the RSF had executed its workers.",

      "text": "Lasting peace demands the amplification of women's voices.\n\nThe Columbia University School of Professional Studies M.S. in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution program, in partnership with Columbia Climate School's Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity (AC4), delivered a powerful exploration of the role of women in major global peace initiatives across Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America this International Women's Month.\n\n\u201cTaking Space: Women, Peace, and Leadership,\u201d the inaugural event of the Women, Peace, and Leadership (WPL) program, delved into the roles of women in various aspects of peace and security around the globe\u2014from grassroots movements in post-Soviet nations to the vibrant, defiant art of Colombian street collectives. The multidisciplinary event was held at the Lee C. Bollinger Forum on Columbia\u2019s Morningside Heights campus.\n\nChilean Women's Artistic Activism\n\nAuthor and human rights attorney Flynn Coleman recalled the \u201cloud energy\u201d of a room of Chilean women making memorial tapestries that depicted scenes of disappearances and torture under former president Augusto Pinochet.\n\n\u201cThis art wasn\u2019t just art. It was justice, it was resistance,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she noted that the communal effort also involved building financial and business skills, pausing to ask: \u201cWhose story isn\u2019t being told? Who still isn\u2019t at the table?\u201d Her question pointed to the need for higher-level representation in peace negotiations, and was addressed by the other members of the panel, which was moderated by Dr. Beth Fisher-Yoshida, director of the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution program.\n\nAmplifying Women's Voices in Peacebuilding\n\nJulia Vassileva, a visiting scholar at Columbia Climate School's AC4, discussed the roles of women in peacebuilding in post-Soviet spaces. She noted that women have often been involved in peace efforts at the grassroots level, but upper level work is done by diplomats, who are predominantly male. Research has shown, however, that negotiations are resolved more quickly and agreements last longer when women are involved, she said.\n\nCatherine Andela, a senior gender adviser and chief of the Gender Unit at the UN Department of Peace Operations, discussed her fieldwork in West Africa and the Middle East. She brought the two previous positions together, saying that when women move into positions of power, they need to bring the voices of women \u201con the ground\u201d with them.\n\nDuring a brief Q&A, Andela responded to a question about the qualities women bring to the table by noting their emotional intelligence and insights.\n\nNegotiations are \u201ctense environments where, if there were only men in the room, then they would be shouting at each other and very ego-driven, not finding an agreement,\u201d Vassileva said.\n\nPublic Art as Historical Memory\n\nFollowing the screening of La Ciudad de las Amigas (The City of Friends), a documentary about the Pira\u00f1as Crew of graffiti artists founded 12 years ago, the director and several members of the crew discussed the film and their work.\n\n\u201cThe hip hop and street art world is a very masculine and male-dominated world,\u201d said Lieke Prins, a crew member and doctoral candidate in Latin American studies. \u201cAs women, we have to continue to persist and resist these masculine structures,\u201d she said, noting that the crew has faced backlash from lewd comments to having their murals defaced.\n\nThose realities were made evident in the Pira\u00f1as documentary. Director Juliana Ruiz took the moment to express pride in the film and in the crew. \u201cIt\u2019s a great start and a great way to honor the girls that are part of the crew,\u201d she said. \u201cWe dreamed to be here, we dreamt of this day.\u201d\n\nThe documentary shows the challenges women face, according to Anyela Vanegas Arango, a crew member and attorney specializing in gender issues. Arango\u2019s comments were translated by the panel\u2019s moderator, Joan Camilo Lopez, a lecturer in the M.S. in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and program manager for the Earth Institute at Columbia University. Other women have followed the Pira\u00f1as lead and initiated their own public art projects, she said.\n\nArango called street art a form of \u201chistorical memory,\u201d a way to spread censored information and pay tribute to victims of violence. \u201cUrban art serves another purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt communicates things that the people do not want to communicate, that the conventional media doesn\u2019t communicate.\u201d\n\nThe event made clear how, through art, activism, and diplomacy, some women are finding ways to record history while women in other parts of the world are working to become the shapers of history.\n\nView the entire \u201cTaking Space: Women, Peace, and Leadership\u201d discussion in the two-part video below:",

      "text": "Congo\u2019s government and Rwanda-backed rebels are meeting in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar for much-anticipated talks in a renewed push for peace in the conflict-battered eastern Congo, where the insurgents have seized vast territory, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe decades-long conflict escalated in January, when the M23 rebels advanced and seized the strategic eastern Congolese city of Goma, followed by the town of Bukavu in February. The fighting has killed some 3,000 people and raised the fears of a wider regional war.\n\nAccording to officials from both sides, the delegations from Congo\u2019s government and the M23 rebel group also met on Wednesday in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations.\n\nThe talks follow a recent Qatar-facilitated meeting between Congolese and Rwandan presidents in Doha and failed efforts by neighboring countries to get both parties to return to dialogue and recommit themselves to a peace deal they each accuse the other of violating.\n\nAmong the demands by the rebels is that Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi annul \u201call death sentences and prosecution\u201d of M23 members, the official within the rebels said. The delegation is led by Bertrand Bisimwa, deputy coordinator of the Congo River Alliance that includes the M23.\n\nCongo\u2019s government delegation is mostly made up of officials from the national security services. They demand the rebels withdraw from territory seized in the conflict-hit region, according to a Congolese official.\n\nAnalysts were quick to describe the meeting as meaningful but were wary about any immediate positive outcomes.\n\nA successful outcome of the meeting in Doha would \u201cdepend on the ability of the mediator to maintain pressure on the various stakeholders, and particularly Rwanda, and to keep them on the table,\u201d according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol.\n\nMoleka added that rebel withdrawal would not be easy without pressure from the international community on Rwanda, citing when the M23 briefly captured Goma in 2012 before pulling out.\n\nM23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world\u2019s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.\n\nThe rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the east.\n\nCorneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance, recently told The Associated Press that international sanctions and Congo\u2019s proposed minerals deal with the United States in search of peace would not stop the fighting.\n\n\u201cAs long as there are no binding measures on Rwanda or the M23, these measures will remain a dead matter,\u201d said Moleka of the Congolese think tank.",

They smile, they shake hands, they offer us one liners about having \u201cproductive discussions.\u201d They\u2019re all, all nearly all, in suits, and they\u2019re all men.\n\nSo where are the women\u2019s voices in this deal making? Where is the influence of the people, women and men, who actually live in the conflict zones, who know better than anyone what might be needed to create a peace that will last, and that is fair? That\u2019s the question we discuss on Inside Geneva this week, with a roundtable of four dynamic, creative women.\n\nMore\n\nInside Geneva: where are women\u2019s voices in peace talks?\n\nThis content was published on In Ukraine, and in the Middle East, men say they are negotiating peace. But are they?\n\nRead more: Inside Geneva: where are women\u2019s voices in peace talks?\n\nEnding war is not the same as peace\n\nWe met in Swissinfo\u2019s broadcasting\u2019s studio just across the road from Switzerland\u2019s parliament, where Deborah Schibler, Leandra Bias, Mahide Aslan, and Larissa Lee, were taking part in a day long debate on women, peace and security.\n\nSchibler is director of Peace Women across the Globe (PWAG), an international network of women in peacebuilding. While she does not dismiss the current attempts to end the fighting in Ukraine, she warns against quick and easy deals.\n\n\u201cEnding war is necessary to peace without a doubt,\u201d she tells Inside Geneva. \u201cBut ending war does not mean peace. So whenever these men use the word peace in order to say ceasefire, stop the guns, this is not peace.\u201d\n\nBias, of Bern University\u2019s Institute of Political Science, also warns that an \u201cilliberal regime\u201d which suppresses gender identity and equality, as Russia has been doing, should be a red flag for wider conflict, before that conflict even starts. \u201cDemocracy, peace and gender equality, they mutually reinforce each other\u201d she explains. \u201cUsually when you have democracy, gender equality flourishes, but the other way around as well.\u201d\n\nIf we dig a little deeper into what is happening in a state which is suppressing democracy and gender equality, she adds \u201cwe would actually have a much better understanding of the drivers of conflict, and therefore also of prevention and resolution of a conflict.\u201d\n\nWomen shut out\n\nAnd while we don\u2019t see women participating in peace negotiations, that is not, our podcast guests insist, because they don\u2019t want to. Lee, also of PWAG, gave us a classic example. Last year in Geneva, preliminary talks were organised to try to bring Sudan\u2019s brutal civil conflict to an end.\n\nWho was invited? The leaders of the two warring sides. No women. But, Lee explains, \u201ca delegation of 15 Sudanese women just showed up despite this. They just said, well, we were not invited, but we\u2019re going to come anyway.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the leader of one of the two warring sides decided he wasn\u2019t interested in coming to Geneva, but the 15 women \u201creally used that opportunity\u201d Lee says, to speak to everyone there, including US and Saudi diplomats, as well as officials from the United Nations and the African Union.\n\n\u201cThey really lobbied them to listen to Sudanese women and civil society at large.\u201d\n\nAnd what about peacekeeping?\n\nAs Schibler told us, the absence of war is not actually peace. But it can be a start. If a ceasefire in Ukraine is agreed, peacekeepers may be deployed to make sure it holds, and give some breathing space towards building a sustainable peace.\n\nWhen we think peacekeepers, most of us immediately imagine a man in a blue helmet, but Aslan, head of women and diversity in the Swiss Armed Forces, tells us why it is crucial women have a role here too.\n\n\u201cThe contribution of women, including as peacekeepers, is a game changer\u201d she tells Inside Geneva. \u201cYou have an easier access, for example, to the population.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trust building, which is somehow easier for women to do. During this phase of rebuilding trust, it is much easier when there are mixed teams or women teams doing this task.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen, women\u2019s perspective, gender perspectives, human security perspectives have to be in every process and every structure of armed forces\u201d, she concludes.\n\nReject the transactional\n\nThe conclusion of this discussion is that sustainable peace cannot be achieved by one side imposing a \u201cdeal\u201d on another. Schibler suggests the current talks over Ukraine can barely be described as peace negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe have to stop saying, OK, this is peace now. That what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re building peace. That\u2019s not true. Refuse to hear the word peace when actually what is meant is a transactional win, or even blackmail.\u201d\n\nBias agrees; these talks show, from the US and Russia, a desire for wealth, power, and territory \u2013 not a recipe for peace. \u201cWhat the US is doing right now, it\u2019s an extractivist assertion of power\u201d she says. \u201cArguably even a second imperial ambition that we are seeing now in the picture, alongside Russia.\u201d\n\nSo is real peace achievable? Yes, but it takes time, patience, hard work, and more talent and tolerance than the current \u201cnegotiators\u201d are displaying. It must be both diverse and inclusive, women must be at the table. And if they are not given a seat, as Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to be elected to the US Congress said \u201cbring a folding chair.\u201d Listen to Inside Geneva to hear that discussion in full.\n\nvm",

      "title": "Sudan: Two Years into Conflict, Freedom House Urges End to Violence, Accountability for Perpetrators",
      "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014In recognition of the second anniversary of the ongoing conflict in Sudan between the regular Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Freedom House interim Copresident Annie Boyajian issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cAs the war in Sudan enters its third year, Freedom House urges greater action from the international community to bring an end to the conflict and address the ongoing humanitarian crisis it has caused. We condemn the SAF and RSF\u2019s indiscriminate attacks on civilians and deliberate violence against human rights defenders, civil society groups, political opponents, and members of certain ethnic groups. The recent SAF takeover of Khartoum has featured an intense wave of attacks against targeted ethnic groups and political opponents. Accountability is urgently needed for the egregious human rights violations committed by both sides amid a war that has resulted in the displacement of nearly 14 million people and more than 150,000 deaths.\n\n\u201cFreedom House is concerned that the significant involvement of external actors is complicating peace efforts as SAF and RSF commanders compete for dominance. We are monitoring the role of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the RSF\u2019s main sponsor and business partner. Egypt, on the other hand, provides military and political support to the SAF. Turkey has also played a destabilizing role by supplying arms to the SAF. By backing opposing factions to advance their own strategic interests, these external actors fuel and prolong the conflict, each making peace an increasingly elusive prospect.\n\n\u201cWe call on the United States and the European Union, in collaboration with the African Union, to increase pressure on the SAF and RSF to immediately end hostilities and return to civilian governance. We call on democratic governments to issue sanctions and public condemnations aimed at discouraging foreign support to the belligerent parties. Additional targeted sanctions against the leaders of SAF and RSF and their businesses should be levied, and arms embargoes on the country should be rigorously enforced.\n\n\u201cMoreover, we strongly recommend the inclusion of civilian representatives from Sudan\u2019s prodemocracy movement in any negotiations, especially women and youth, who have been at the forefront of the fight for justice and accountability. The Trump administration should reinstate and fully staff a special envoy to prioritize this effort and peace negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe honor the immense bravery and resolve of the Sudanese people in the face of this horrific conflict. A durable peace\u2014which is essential for the security and prosperity of the broader region\u2014will require recognizing and prioritizing their well-being. We urge the international community to support comprehensive investigations into human rights violations, working through domestic and international institutions to hold perpetrators accountable and deliver justice for victims.\u201d\n\nBackground:\n\nAfter military commanders and a prodemocracy protest movement ousted the repressive regime of longtime president Omar al-Bashir and his National Congress Party in 2019, Sudan was ruled by a transitional government in which military and civilian leaders agreed to share power until national elections could be held. The process was thrown into turmoil in late 2021 when the military leadership dissolved the transitional government in a coup and cracked down on the ensuing prodemocracy protests. In April 2023, hostilities broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a group originally formed by al-Bashir, and the fighting quickly spread across the country. The ongoing conflict has been characterized by extreme levels of violence and catastrophic human rights abuses.\n\nIn the latter half of 2024, the SAF launched a series of coordinated offensives, reclaiming key territories in and around Khartoum, the capital, for the first time since the RSF took control of the city at the onset of the war. Fighting in Khartoum State intensified in 2025. The SAF retook additional areas around the capital, drove RSF forces out of Omdurman, recaptured a vital oil refinery, and regained near-total control of Bahri. In February, SAF forces ended the RSF\u2019s two-year siege of Obeid, a strategic city with railway connections to Khartoum.\n\nIn western Sudan, the RSF has continued its attacks on local rebel forces, SAF personnel, and civilians. El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, remains the center of fighting between the SAF and its allies and the RSF. RSF targeting of non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur has raised concerns of genocide. The humanitarian crisis in Darfur persists, with both sides accused of impeding and looting aid deliveries. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to freeze humanitarian aid threatens to worsen malnutrition and famine in the region.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in at least 150,000 deaths and has displaced nearly 14 million people, creating a dire humanitarian crisis and a breeding ground for human rights violations, including ethnically motivated atrocities, sexual and gender-based violence, and unprecedented attacks against human rights advocates and civic activists.\n\nSudan is rated Not Free in Freedom in the World 2025 and Not Free in Freedom on the Net 2024.",

      "title": "Q&A: Nobel Prize-winning researcher and BU grad discusses vaccine development, vaccine hesitancy, and preparing for another pandemic",
      "text": "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world, Dr. Drew Weissman\u2019s contributions to the development of the vaccines remain monumental.\n\nWeissman\u2019s medical study brought him to the Boston area. He earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from Brandeis University and an MD and PhD from Boston University. After a residency at Beth Israel Hospital, he studied HIV at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nIn 1997, Weissman arrived at Penn Medicine and met Dr. Katalin (Kati) Karik\u00f3, with whom he would later share a Nobel Prize. Eight years of research led them to their discovery that messenger RNA (mRNA) could be modified and delivered in fat droplets called lipid nanoparticles, enabling it to trigger the immune system to fight disease.\n\nMore than a decade later, these breakthroughs proved crucial to using mRNA in COVID vaccines. In 2023, Weissman and Karik\u00f3 were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\n\nAs the pandemic\u2019s impact lingers, Weissman and his team are working to develop several more vaccines, including a pan-coronavirus vaccine, a universal flu vaccine, and a herpes vaccine. Boston.com sat down with Weissman for a Q&A about vaccine development, vaccine hesitancy, governmental involvement, and the prospect of another pandemic.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow did you begin at Penn Medicine?\n\nI came here from the NIH, where I was an HIV dendritic cell researcher in Tony Fauci\u2019s lab. I had been there for seven years, and I came to Penn and started my own lab, and that\u2019s when I met Kati Karik\u00f3. Kati had been working on RNA for around 10 years and wasn\u2019t getting very far with it. We met at the photocopier and started talking and working together, and that led us to here.\n\nCould you tell me about your 2005 discoveries that ultimately lead to you winning the Nobel Prize?\n\nThat was the culmination of about eight years of work that Kati and I did, and we first noticed that RNA was very inflammatory, and that was unexpected at the time. We tried to figure out why it was so inflammatory, and that led us to study modified nucleosides. The 2005 paper is demonstrating that if you put modified nucleosides in the RNA, it loses a lot of its inflammatory activity.\n\nHow did those discoveries pave the way for the COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nThat was the first step to show we could get rid of inflammation. A couple years after that, we showed that the modified RNA was translated much better than unmodified. So, in the mid 1990s, drug companies, biotech companies, did clinical trials that didn\u2019t work using RNA and gave up. [They] said \u201cit\u2019s too inflammatory, it doesn\u2019t make enough protein, it\u2019s too hard to work with,\u201d and they stopped using it. We got rid of the inflammation, and we increased the amount of protein the RNA made by 10,000 fold.\n\nThree years after the pandemic began, you won the Nobel Prize in Medicine with Dr. Karik\u00f3. What was your reaction to that?\n\nPenn had been warning us for every year after the vaccine was released, and they were actually sending photographers wherever we went, just in case we won. I got a text from Kati at 4 in the morning. Usually they call at 6:30 for the East Coast, but they called Kati earlier and said, \u201cYou and Drew won.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe it when Kati first called, or when they first called, because we have a lot of problems with anti-vaxxers and crazy people attacking us, threatening us, and I thought they were playing a joke.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic and amid a surge in anti-vaccine activism, what are your thoughts on that resistance to vaccines?\n\nThe resistance has been around since vaccines were invented back in 1796 when [Edward] Jenner first made a cow pox vaccine. What surprised me about the current anti-vaxxers is that they\u2019re based in our government, and they\u2019re promoted by our government. I always thought the job of the government was to help people and to make them healthier, and now we\u2019ve got a significant portion of our government who is trying to cancel vaccines, and is turning against science, and I had never seen that before. That\u2019s a very upsetting part of all of this.\n\nGiven the recent funding cuts at the NIH and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. entering the scene at the HHS, do you feel like we\u2019re unprepared for another pandemic?\n\nThe fear is that the NIH and RFK are going to cancel all RNA vaccines. There\u2019s a huge platform of new drugs, new therapeutics that are being developed that could potentially be stopped. That\u2019s going to lead to more deaths, worsening health, and what the conservatives should care about, it\u2019s going to lead to China and other countries being the leaders in these fields instead of the US.\n\nWhat else should the general public know about the viability and safety of vaccines?\n\nStudies have been done on who\u2019s responsible for the anti-vaccine misinformation, and what they found is that the majority of the biggest anti-vax people are split between lawyers who sue vaccine companies for made-up autism or made-up adverse events to make money, or they\u2019re physicians who invent osteopathic, worthless treatments. RFK Jr. used to be a lawyer that worked for a company that sued drug companies because of made-up vaccine ailments. People don\u2019t believe this or don\u2019t understand this. They think, \u2018oh, well, these people are on my side,\u2019 and they\u2019re on the internet telling me to be careful. And they believe it.\n\nHow are vaccine researchers preparing for another pandemic?\n\nSo, there\u2019s two ways to prepare. The first is to establish testing and protection, PPEs, masks, gloves, the ability to quickly make testing equipment. The second is to make vaccines. Often, we don\u2019t know what the next pandemic is going to be. We know influenza gives us a pandemic every once in a while, so what we\u2019ve been doing is making pan vaccines, or universal vaccines, that work against all coronaviruses and all influenza viruses. That way, you\u2019ve got a vaccine that\u2019s ready to go the minute cases start appearing, and you don\u2019t have to spend 10 months making a brand new vaccine.\n\nThere\u2019s not much the public can do to physically prevent a pandemic, but they should be talking with their legislators about making sure the government and NIH researchers are funded and prepared for the next pandemic.",

      "title": "Why an Aussie lab is racing to make a vaccine for haemorrhagic fever",
      "text": "Examine, a free weekly newsletter covering science with a sceptical, evidence-based eye, is sent every Tuesday. You\u2019re reading an excerpt \u2013 sign up to get the whole newsletter in your inbox.\n\nThe deadly disease was kept secret until February 10.\n\nThat\u2019s the day Professor Keith Chappell, from the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland, joined a meeting with international pandemic experts and was briefed on Bolivian Chapare virus.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare and terrible haemorrhagic fever spread by rodents that inflicts bleeding gums, fever, pain behind the eyes and, in 60 per cent of victims, death. Five outbreaks have hit Bolivia since 2003, the most recent in January this year, which killed a farmer in his 50s.\n\nThis zoonotic virus leaps from rodents \u2013 the key suspect being the small-eared pygmy rice rat \u2013 into humans, but struggles to spread from person to person, so there\u2019s no significant risk of international spread of the disease. Should the virus evolve to become more infectious between people, however, it\u2019s one of the diseases that could threaten the world with the next pandemic.\n\nLoading\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason why Chappell and his team have been tasked with crafting a vaccine for the Chapare virus in 150 days, under conditions akin to the time pressure of a real pandemic. Think of it as a war game exercise.\n\nThe challenge is part of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)\u2019s 100 Days Mission, an initiative aimed at building our capacity to roll out a vaccine within three months when the next global pandemic illness \u2013 dubbed Disease X \u2013 strikes.\n\nBut is a 100-day vaccine development fast enough to prevent a pandemic? And how are Australian scientists racing to create new vaccines at unprecedented speeds?\n\nIs \u2018light-speed\u2019 vaccine development still too slow?\n\nThe aim of this game is twofold. The first goal is to get labs match-fit for rapid vaccine development upon the emergence of Disease X. The second is to build a library of \u201cprototype\u201d vaccines for each of the 25 virus families that pose a pandemic threat to humans.\n\n\u201cMy team are facing a lot of pressure, they\u2019re excited about it and nervous,\u201d Chappell says of the challenge. While CEPI\u2019s eventual goal is to get labs cracking on a 100-day timescale, Chappell\u2019s team is aiming for the slightly more achievable, but still daunting, deadline of 150 days.\n\nThe fastest vaccine ever made was one of Pfizer\u2019s early COVID-19 jabs, which took 337 days between identification of the disease and approval of the vaccine. And that had the eyes, funding and support of the entire world. Before the COVID pandemic, the fastest vaccine was for mumps; it took four years.\n\n\u201cSo this is light-speed for this type of work,\u201d Chappell says of the 150-day goal.\n\nBut even that may be too slow to meet CEPI\u2019s goal of ending the existential threat of pandemics. According to Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, former chief scientist of the World Health Organisation and one of the authors of an influential paper that led to CEPI\u2019s formation in 2017, to truly end the threat of pandemics we\u2019d need to cut the vaccine-making window to a mere 30 days. A 100-day vaccine wouldn\u2019t have stopped COVID-19 going global.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say a three-month vaccine couldn\u2019t have enormous benefits. A recent study in The Lancet used modelling to estimate how the pandemic would\u2019ve played out if the COVID-19 vaccine had been made and released within 100 days of the virus\u2019s genome being identified.\n\nTheir conclusion: it would have saved 8.33 million people from dying of COVID by the end of 2021 \u2013 57 per cent of the global deaths due to the virus to that date \u2013 and prevented $14.35 trillion of economic havoc.\n\nClamping down on novel viruses\n\nChappell is one of the inventors of \u201cmolecular clamp\u201d vaccine technology, which he\u2019s using to pursue a vaccine for Chapare virus. The technique works by borrowing a non-infectious protein from a virus to grab onto a lab-made spike protein.\n\n\u201cViral families such as coronaviruses, influenza viruses, ebola, all have these spike proteins on their surface. But they\u2019re naturally very hard to produce in a lab or manufacturing setting,\u201d Chappell says.\n\n\u201cWhat the molecular clamp does is allow us to produce those proteins at high quantities and ensure that they\u2019re locked into the optimal conformation so that they produce a strong neutralising immune response.\u201d\n\nThe spike protein triggers the body to produce antibodies against the virus, building resistance to infection. The clamp is key because spike proteins quickly deform in the body; they jackknife when they stab into a host cell, fusing with the membrane and allowing the virus to invade.\n\nOnce this fusion occurs and spikes deform, they trigger a much weaker immune response. But when fused to a molecular clamp, the spike protein is held tightly in shape and doesn\u2019t deform, so it triggers the robust immune response you want from a vaccine.\n\nThe actual clamp stays the same between each new vaccine; Chappell and his team just need the sequence of the spike protein for whatever virus they\u2019re trying to immunise against so they can grow it in the lab and stick it to the clamp. That\u2019s what makes the method well suited to rapid vaccine development.\n\nBut doing it all in 150 days is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cYou need to iron out all the issues, all the kinks, everything that can go wrong,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cIt really is a moonshot goal to try to have a vaccine that\u2019s safe, effective and of the right quality to be used in humans within that sort of time frame.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lesson they learnt in 2020.\n\nFixing false HIV readings\n\nThe team were racing to create a COVID-19 vaccine with their molecular clamp tech in 2020, and had progressed to human trials, but then had to call off the project after their vaccine triggered false-positive HIV results in some patients.\n\nThere was never any actual chance of HIV infection, but the iteration of the clamp they were using had been constructed out of proteins borrowed from HIV, hence the false-positives. The devastated scientists shelved the project.\n\nThey have spent the past few years rebuilding the clamp using a different viral protein, derived from an Icelandic sheep virus that has never infected humans.\n\nLoading\n\nNow they\u2019re brewing up a 50-litre batch of a version of the clamp fused to a Chapare virus spike protein \u2013 enough to theoretically immunise millions of people.\n\nThe goal is to finalise the vaccine, test it in mice and provide a dossier of safety information to an independent board of reviewers for analysis before the 150 days are up in July.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re essentially asking the question: if this was an actual emergency, would you give us permission to put this into humans?\u201d Chappell says.",

This unique approach \u2013 the main component is a membrane similar to contact lens materials \u2013 means they are not only more affordable but also safer and more environmentally friendly.\n\nThis technology is aimed at giving customers more control of their energy use at home, ultimately lowering their electricity bills and helping to reduce fuel poverty in the UK. From its early trials, Superdielectrics estimates its technology could save UK consumers up to 85% on their domestic energy bills, while substantially reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs one of the UK\u2019s leading energy suppliers, E.ON can call on a wealth of data on the energy needs of millions of domestic and business customers, along with EV owners, enabling Superdielectrics to fine tune its technology, and accelerate the development of a more affordable electricity storage system for domestic use.\n\nJim Heathcote, Chief Executive of Superdielectrics, said: \u201cWe are delighted to sign this ground-breaking collaboration agreement with such a globally respected energy group as E.ON. Their support and insight will enable us to accelerate the development of our technology and bring it into production far sooner. We believe that our technology has the potential to revolutionise power generation and consumption and deliver enormous environmental and cost benefits to millions of people. We are all looking forward to working with them.\u201d\n\nJulian Lennertz, Chief Commercial Officer at E.ON Next, added: \u201cThe energy transition is about making energy more affordable and more sustainable, and to do that we\u2019re always looking for and encouraging new technologies to make energy better for customers. Whether our approach is in-house or through partnerships, we\u2019re always looking to come up with new ways to benefit our customers and to make new energy work for everyone. Superdielectrics\u2019 technology could be a vital part of creating a cleaner, lower-cost energy future for everyone.\u201d\n\nSuperdielectrics\u2019 technology was demonstrated last year with the unveiling of the Faraday I, a breakthrough polymer-based battery. Superdielectrics\u2019 system offers the following benefits:\n\nFast charging: Fully charges in just 30 minutes, compared to hours for other battery types\n\nLow cost: The technology does not rely on rare metals, making its materials cheaper than lithium-ion batteries\n\nSustainability: Built with readily available, non-flammable, materials and easily recyclable\n\nLong lifecycle: Comparable lifespan to existing batteries, with potential for even longer use\n\nThe demand for renewable energy is growing rapidly, so the need for energy storage has never been greater. Superdielectrics believes its system can compete with lithium-ion batteries in power, but without the same reliance on the mining of minerals which are needed for more traditional battery materials.\n\nSuperdielectrics is currently working on significant upgrades to its technology as it progresses towards commercial development and intends to make an important announcement about the development of its technology later in 2025.",

      "title": "5 Screener Secrets Every Trader Should Know!",
      "text": ".\n\nNavigating the Indian stock market can feel overwhelming, especially with thousands of stocks to choose from. Stock screeners really come in handy here. They help traders quickly filter out the noise and find the right opportunities. However, using screeners effectively is more than just clicking a few filters. To really get ahead, you need to know a few things that experienced traders swear by. These \u201cscreener secrets\u201d can give you a real edge in the market.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to reveal 5 stock screener secrets every trader should know so they can outsmart the market.\n\nWhat Is a Stock Screener?\n\nA stock screener is a tool that allows traders to filter and analyze stocks based on specific criteria, such as market capitalization, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, dividend yield, and other financial metrics.\n\nBy inputting these parameters, users can efficiently narrow down a vast universe of stocks to a manageable list that aligns with their strategies and goals.\n\nStock screeners are invaluable for identifying potential opportunities, saving time, and improving decision-making by focusing on objective data.\n\n5 Screener Secrets Every Trader Should Know\n\nLeveraging a fundamental stock screener can take your trading strategy to the next level by quickly narrowing down stocks based on essential financial indicators. Here are five powerful secrets to help you make the most of these tools in the market:\n\n1. Combining Fundamental and Technical Filters\n\nCombining fundamental and technical analysis, often referred to as \"technofunda,\" enhances stock selection by leveraging the strengths of both approaches.\n\nFundamental analysis evaluates a company's intrinsic value through financial metrics like revenue, profit margins, and growth potential, providing insights into long-term viability.\n\nOn the flip side, Technical analysis examines historical price movements and trading volumes to identify patterns and trends, aiding in timing market entries and exits.\n\nUsing these methods allows traders to pinpoint strongly performing companies and time their trades accordingly to prevailing market trends which leads to better choices.\n\n2. Using Custom Alerts for Timely Decisions\n\nCustom alerts in stock screeners allow traders to be notified instantly when certain market conditions are met, facilitating timely and informed trading decisions.\n\nFor example, a trader might set an alert for when a stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) surpasses 70, indicating potential overbought conditions.\n\nUpon this trigger, the screener sends a notification, allowing the trader to assess and act promptly, such as considering selling the stock to capitalize on anticipated price movements.\n\nThis proactive approach ensures that traders remain responsive to market dynamics without the need for constant manual monitoring.\n\n3. Focusing on Volume and Liquidity Metrics\n\nIn the Indian stock market, prioritizing volume and liquidity metrics is essential for traders aiming for efficient and effective transactions. High trading volume indicates high interest from market participants, facilitating smoother entry and exit from positions with minimal price impact.\n\nLiquidity, reflecting the ease of buying or selling an asset without causing significant price changes, is vital for maintaining price stability and reducing transaction costs.\n\nFor instance, intraday traders, utilizing an intraday screener that filters stocks based on these metrics, can enhance decision-making by highlighting securities that offer the best opportunities for quick trades without substantial price slippage.\n\nNeglecting these factors may lead to challenges in executing trades at desired prices, especially in less liquid stocks where large orders can disproportionately affect market prices.\n\n4. Leveraging Sector-Specific Screening\n\nSector-specific screening involves focusing your stock analysis on particular industries or sectors within the market, allowing you to identify companies that are likely to benefit from sectoral trends or economic developments.\n\nBy narrowing your search to specific sectors, you can compare companies operating under similar conditions, making it easier to spot those with superior performance or growth potential.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful in the Indian market, where diverse sectors such as Information Technology, Pharmaceuticals, and Consumer Goods may experience varying growth trajectories.\n\nUsing sector-specific screening helps you focus your market strategy on strong-performing industries, so you can make better profits and avoid some of the risks that come with overall market ups and downs.\n\n5. Regularly Updating and Backtesting Screening Criteria\n\nRegularly updating and backtesting your stock screening criteria is essential to keep pace with the ever-changing market conditions. By revisiting and refining your filters, you ensure that your strategy remains aligned with current market dynamics.\n\nBacktesting these updated criteria using historical data allows you to evaluate their effectiveness, providing insights into potential profitability and risks.\n\nFor instance, if your screener highlights the top gainers today, backtesting can reveal whether these stocks have historically maintained their upward momentum or experienced quick reversals.\n\nThis continuous process of updating and testing helps you make informed decisions and adapt to the market's fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing stock screeners the right way can help you trade better in the Indian market. These five simple tips - like mixing technical and fundamental filters or focusing on sectors - can save you time and improve your stock picks. Try these screener secrets yourself, keep testing them, and you\u2019ll become a smarter, more confident trader over time.\n\nDisclaimer: No Business Standard Journalist was involved in creation of this content\n\nTopics : share market\n\nDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.

      "title": "Gold\u2019s record has room to run as crude oil, US stocks teeter",
      "text": "This analysis is by Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Analyst Mike McGlone. It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index\u2019s 2025 gain of about 8% to March 28 is attributable to the stalwart metals, and at potential risk if the US stock market keeps sliding. Can copper beat gold in a year of unprecedented US austerity and tariffs, with China increasingly relying on stimulus? Our performance bias is with gold. But at $3,000 an ounce the stretched bull may need to be fed, and a top candidate to do so is further reversion in US equities and Treasury-bond yields. The Trump administration\u2019s goals for lower energy prices and yields have the benefit of preexisting trends.\n\nCME-traded copper\u2019s $5.37-a-pound record high on March 26 could have a similar fate as 2024\u2019s $5.20 peak, which subsequently bottomed near $4. In grains, ample South American supply suggests it may take a Corn Belt drought to avoid lower prices.\n\nAbundance vs. high stocks\n\nHot for a reason: Gold vs. a shift in the post-WWII world order\n\nCommodities and gold are recovering from recent multidecade lows vs. the US stock market, and that trend may have lots of room to run, with worthy catalysts. Unprecedented US austerity and tariffs, along with deflation from China akin to Japan about 30 years ago, could sustain the precious metal as 2025\u2019s top performer.\n\nNormalization may be at hand: Gold vs. US stocks\n\nThe inordinate burden on a rising US stock market to lift all boats may have reached an apex, with deflationary implications for commodities except gold. Our graphic shows the per-ounce price of the metal divided by the S&P 500 breaching 0.50 \u2014 a key threshold in 1972 and 2007. The pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were historical distortions that pumped money, commodities and asset prices to unsustainable levels, as evidenced by WTI crude oil at about $70 a barrel on March 28 vs. 2022\u2019s $130 high.\n\nCrude and the grains are on track for low-price cures, and if US stock-market-cap-to-GDP reverts toward the 2000 high near 1.5, buoyant copper and base metals will face similar deflationary forces. What stops it is a key question, and unprecedented US austerity and tariffs could add fuel to typical downward cycles.\n\nLots of reversion room, with a worthy catalyst\n\nMultidecade lows in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot and Hang Seng indexes vs. the S&P 500 in 2024 may have found a spark for recovery. The unprecedented combination of the Trump administration\u2019s austerity and tariffs at a time of accelerating deflationary technology \u2014 as evidenced the latest BYD electric vehicles able to charge for about a 250-mile range in just five minutes \u2014 might suggest some normalization of elevated US equity prices. Our half-century chart shows the vast room for Chinese stocks and commodities to catch up to beta.\n\nBut it\u2019s the potential for the S&P 500 to revert some of its roughly 10x gain since 2009 that may be 2025\u2019s most powerful force for deflation reciprocal to the inflation. If US stocks stabilize, energy and grain prices still face downward paths, but if beta keeps reverting, deflation may reign.\n\nCommodity consistency: Gold beating crude\n\nGold at the top of our annual-performance dashboard and crude oil at the bottom may gain momentum if the US stock market declines. One of the most enduring trends in commodity prices since 2008 has been a rise in the number of crude barrels equal to an ounce of gold, along with growing US government budget deficits and energy-output surpluses. At about 44 on March 28, gold/crude is up from its nadir of just below seven about 17 years ago. What stops the store of value from outpacing most commodities is a top question, and a prerequisite for gold to lose some of its luster is competition from rising US rates and equities. That may be changing, as shown by gold ETFs shifting to substantial inflows.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $100,000 threshold is looking increasingly like 5,000 in the Nasdaq 25 years ago, with risk-asset implications.\n\nDeflation from the inflation may be commodity tilt\n\nThe most supply-to-price elastic sector \u2014 the grains \u2014 at the bottom of our annual-performance dashboard and precious metals at the top are due to the distortions of 2020-22. Where and when do the trends stop? Low-price-cure paths in corn, soybeans and wheat appear similar in oil and natural gas, and absent supply shocks, gravity-pull forces could be toward 2019 levels. That\u2019s about $57 a barrel in WTI crude, which is roughly the US break-even price.\n\nUS-traded copper has been a 2025 stalwart, but because of tariffs that haven\u2019t yet been implemented. The record $5.37 a pound on March 26 could be at risk of similar reversion as 2024\u2019s $5.20 peak. The bottom came at about $4. That gold has only three companions \u2014 silver, platinum and palladium \u2013 may show its attributes vs. Bitcoin, which has millions of crypto dependents.",

      "title": "ARTS AND HUMANITIES: Museum highlights work of major Gullah artist",
      "text": "During the years that S.C. Humanities sponsored the South Carolina Book Festival in Columbia, the work of one artist was chosen repeatedly as the featured image on posters advertising that annual weekend event. That artist is Jonathan Green, whose vibrantly colored paintings and prints celebrate the Gullah culture of the South Carolina and Georgia Low Country.\n\nUntil the end of August, the Morris Museum of Art will be hosting a special exhibition titled \u201cJonathan Green: The Aesthetics of Heritage.\u201d This show of pieces from the museum\u2019s permanent collection represents the largest assemblage of the artist\u2019s work in a public repository.\n\nBorn and raised in the hamlet of Garden\u2019s Corner, Beaufort County, Green knows Gullah culture from the inside. His maternal grandmother taught him the language, an English-based, primarily oral tongue heavily influenced by African vocabulary and grammar. He also immersed himself in the everyday activities of his small, closely knit community; in fact, so many of the artist\u2019s images can be seen as his attempt to capture boyhood memories.\n\nThe 23 works on view in the museum\u2019s Harriet and Martin Dolin Gallery through Aug. 31 can be divided into subject areas reflective of the shared experience of generations of the descendants of the West African people enslaved and brought to this country in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nA number of works make reference, for example, to the harvesting of the bounties of both land and sea. The coastal plain of our state was, according to some estimates the most heavily enslaved area of the South, largely because British colonists intent on cultivating rice needed a labor force conversant with managing that particular cash crop. They told slave traders to bring them natives of the so-called Guinea Coast, and these coastal people brought with them a knowledge of growing plants without soil.\n\nThus, so many of the men and women in Green\u2019s art are comfortable in that realm of \u201cmarsh and sea and sky\u201d so lyrically described in Sidney Lanier\u2019s poem \u201cThe Marshes of Glynn.\u201d In \u201cWhite Pony,\u201d for example, a straw-hatted male equestrian sits astride his mount in a stream of pulsating blue. In another painting titled \u201cSitting by the River,\u201d the eye is initially drawn to two figures seated on the shore, with a fish bucket and red dog nearby. Are they engaged in angling or are they mesmerized, along with the viewer, by what Lanier described as the \u201csinuous folds of land\u201d that \u201cfringe\u201d the water as it empties into the sea beyond?\n\nBesides the many images of a population in tune with their environment, Green returns time and again in his work to the social activities of the Gullah people, particularly those linked to musical performance. Over time, African rhythms have informed the evolution of a number of American musical genres whose popularity persists to this day. The large-scale oil on canvas entitled \u201cThe Silver Slipper Club,\u201d for example, features seven couples dancing to some unheard melody, the female figures sport full skirts whose bold patterns are a signature of the artist. It is because of this confluence of decorative designs that Green\u2019s essentially representational works sometimes border on the abstract.\n\nAnother large-scale oil \u201cThe Congregation\u201d offers an additional example of this visual strategy. The lilac-robed choir in the background is overshadowed by the cluster of worshippers facing the viewer in the foreground. Our eyes are attracted to their hats and bedecked torsos, which read collectively like a patchwork quilt.\n\nAccompanying the main exhibition until June 29 is a display of around 30 portraits of the artist himself, all mounted on the walls of the SRP Auditorium on the museum\u2019s ground floor. Among these works is a standout piece by photographer Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, the widow of tennis star Arthur Ashe.",

      "title": "Ranking the 10 most collectible events in sports",
      "text": "The Masters bills itself as \"a tradition unlike any other.\" The Super Bowl is an American sports holiday, but the World Cup final is the most-watched event on the planet. The World Series and Wimbledon go back more than a century, and the Stanley Cup ranks as the coolest trophy in sports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery championship event has its unique qualities and storied history, but which ranks as the most collectible sporting event in the world?\n\nAt cllct, we set out to answer this unanswerable (and heavily debated) question.\n\nWe ranked each event in four categories on a 10-point scale, with the overall ranking determined by the sum of total points. Events are not being ranked against one another within each category, so there can be multiple events receiving the same score for each.\n\nHistorical Significance: This category is not an evaluation of the historical significance of each event to sports generally, rather, it\u2019s looking through the collector\u2019s lens at the significance of collectibles from the history of the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerchandise: How much has merch from the event transcended the ho-hum baseline of a T-shirt with a logo? How much do attendees care about the event\u2019s merch? Do collectors seek out merch from year\u2019s past?\n\nPrice: How expensive are the most significant pieces of memorabilia from the event? We\u2019re talking the best of the best.\n\nVariety: How many options does the event provide collectors?\n\nOK, load up your Mean Tweets, because it's time to get to our rankings:\n\n1. The Masters\n\nHistorical Significance: 9\n\nConsidering Augusta National has trademarked Jim Nantz\u2019s \u201cA tradition unlike any other\u201d catchphrase, it\u2019s a tall task for the tournament to live up to the hype on this front, but golf collectors are really among the most obsessive and, we mean this in a nice way ... nerdy, out there. And it shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very construction and origins of the course itself are a category onto itself, with photos, old stock certificates and assorted documents from more than 90 years ago attracting consistent attention from collectors.\n\nMerch: 9\n\nThis is the easiest category to grade in this entire list. Everything that needs to be said on this front has already been said, so I will just add: Someone spent $11,500 on a set of Masters gnomes from 2018-25 on eBay on Thursday morning.\n\nHowever, it does have to lose a point as there is little to be had to commemorate winners.\n\nPrice: 8\n\nThe Masters undoubtedly punches above its weight class in the high-end category, with Green Jackets worth mid-six figures and up, as well as a claim to the most expensive ticket ever sold \u2014 a pass to the inaugural 1934 Masters, which fetched more than $600,000 in a private sale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVariety: 8\n\nA scroll through the top golf auction house, Golden Age, will give you some idea here: The Masters generates an immensely diverse array of collectibles, from trophies to Type 1 photographs to flags.\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 34\n\n2. World Series\n\nHistorical Significance: 10\n\nIf this was a grade for the sport itself, baseball would receive an 11/10 for this category. But so much of the best and most beloved collectibles from the history of the National Pastime are not specific to the World Series \u2014 rather, various moments, achievements and milestones from the rest of the season.\n\nStill, baseball fans, much like golf fans, are historians, and it is true for baseball collectors as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether it's Don Larsen in 1956 or the Chicago Cubs in 2016, there is no shortage of demand or appreciation here.\n\nMerch: 5\n\nThis is not a highlight for the World Series. Typical of baseball\u2019s purist leanings, there is little in the way of flashy or eye-popping merch beyond the obvious.\n\nPrice: 10\n\nThe World Series has generated some of the top sales in the hobby, including Babe Ruth\u2019s \u201cCalled Shot\u201d jersey, which became the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold at more than $24 million\n\nMickey Mantle\u2019s 1952 World Series jersey fetched $3 million, and Freddie Freeman\u2019s walk-off grand-slam ball from this past World Series sold for $1.56 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVariety: 7\n\nBaseball generates a ton of different pieces of memorabilia generally, perhaps due to the league\u2019s robust authentication program, but the World Series itself doesn\u2019t expand upon that greatly, despite making many of those pieces more desirable.\n\nStill, the availability of comparatively random items like rosin bags and even bases boosts its grade a bit.\n\nTOTAL: 32\n\n3. World Cup\n\nHistorical Significance: 10\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest event for the world\u2019s biggest sport. Enough said.\n\nMerch: 3\n\nThe onsite merchandise presence at the World Cup is extremely lacking, compared with other championship events. We will award points for the Vuvuzela?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrice: 10\n\nDiego Maradona\u2019s \u201cHand of God\u201d jersey from the 1986 World Cup sold for $9.28 million, the third-most expensive piece of sports memorabilia in history.\n\nAdditionally, a set of six Lionel Messi jerseys from the 2022 FIFA World Cup sold for $7.2 million.\n\nVariety: 8\n\nThis in the only event on the list to directly influence significant sports cards: The most expensive soccer card ever sold, a PSA 9 copy of Pele\u2019s 1958 Alifabolaget rookie card, would not exist if it weren\u2019t for the fact Pele\u2019s breakout performance came at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, where the card was manufactured.\n\nAdditionally, Panini\u2019s World Cup stickers are a phenomenon onto themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 31\n\n4. Super Bowl\n\nHistorical Significance: 8\n\nDating back to Super Bowl I in 1967, collectors remain attached to every decade of the game\u2019s history, chasing after early mementos such as tickets, game-used equipment and team-signed items with fervor.\n\nMerch: 8\n\nThe merchandise tent at the Super Bowl could warrant its own zip code, with items ranging from the highest of high ends to everyday workout wear.\n\nThe NFL Shop website nearly crashes every year, with fans flooding to buy championship gear \u2014 just like Eagles fans did in record-setting numbers in February.\n\nHowever, if we are being honest, there is nothing truly special about most Super Bowl merch \u2014 it mainly comes down to the quality and aesthetics of that year\u2019s Super Bowl logo appearing on the usual slew of shirts, hats and hoodies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, we have had some awesome logos over the years, like in 1999 in Miami and 1997 in New Orleans, which can hold their own among the best in sports history.\n\nPrice: 9\n\nWith Super Bowl rings consistently attracting six-figure sums, significant jerseys \u2014 such as Joe Montana\u2019s 1985 and 1989 (he wore it for both games) Super Bowl wins selling for $1.21 million and a full run of tickets to every Super Bowl from 1967-2018 selling for $168,000 \u2014 the biggest game in American sports reflects its importance in its price tag.\n\nVariety: 4\n\nSuper Bowl memorabilia is generally the standard items one would expect from any sporting event of its magnitude. Nothing special on that end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOTAL: 29\n\n5. Olympics\n\nHistorical Significance: 8\n\nIt goes without saying the Olympics, which are as much a cultural fixture as a sports event, represent the epitome of sporting history.\n\nMerch: 5\n\nGiven more than 11 million visitors attended the Summer Games in Paris this past year (many of whom traveling thousands of miles), the cool factor in owning something as simple as a T-shirt with a logo or a pin is super-charged.\n\nPrice: 8\n\nThe original Olympic Manifesto is the fourth-most expensive piece of sports memorabilia in history, selling for $8.8 million. Jesse Owens\u2019 medal from the 1936 games sold for nearly $1.5 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVariety: 7\n\nThe diversity of sports, as well as the availability of unique-to-the-Olympics items such as torches from each Games and medals, buoy the category.\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 28\n\n6. NBA Finals\n\nHistorical Significance: 6\n\nInterestingly, much of the most collectible NBA Finals were played in the 1990s and later, which comes through both in prices and, anecdotally, volume.\n\nNow, the 1990s are history, albeit recent history, but the NBA Finals dates back a good 50 years prior, and you rarely hear much about someone hunting for a piece relating to the Chicago Stags in 1946.\n\nMerch: 7\n\nMuch like the Super Bowl, it\u2019s largely contingent upon the logo. But, it gains major credit for the Finals patch on jerseys, which are awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrice: 8\n\nThis was one of the most difficult categories to grade as it forces one to differentiate between the collectibility of Michael Jordan and the NBA Finals, despite the inextricable link between them both.\n\nThe second-most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold is Jordan\u2019s \u201cLast Dance\u201d jersey from Game 1 of the 1998 Finals, which sold for $10.1 million. But that is more about Jordan than the Finals \u2014 after all, it was literally marketed off Jordan\u2019s docuseries, \"The Last Dance.\" So it can\u2019t get all the credit for that.\n\nVariety: 5\n\nThere is not much out of the ordinary here, with the exception of the aforementioned NBA Finals patches on jerseys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 26\n\n6. Stanley Cup final\n\nHistorical Significance: 8\n\nWith a legacy that dates back to 1893 \u2014 George Lowe\u2019s Montreal AAA ring from the first Stanley Cup sold for more than $65,000 in 2009 \u2014 as well as a brand that carries tremendous prestige, collectors are always looking for items relating to the Cup.\n\nMerch: 4\n\nNot too much to write home about here.\n\nPrice: 8\n\nStanley Cup game-used memorabilia, particularly jerseys and sticks, are among the top-sellers in any sport. A Wayne Gretzky Stanley Cup-clinching game jersey sold for more than $1.4 million.\n\nVariety: 4\n\nPretty much the basics \u2026\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 24\n\n8. Wimbledon\n\nHistorical Significance: 4\n\nWith plenty of parallels to the Masters, the history of Wimbledon in general is awe-inspiring, but tennis collectors simply do not show out in the same way as golf collectors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerch: 8\n\nDo Strawberries and Cream count? No? Well, regardless, tennis has the best fashion in sports, and even the simplistic Wimbledon logo on a white hat is nothing short of iconic. Pure class.\n\nPrice: 6\n\nBig sales are few and far between, with the top items, like rackets and match-used apparel from Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer, crossing the six-figure mark only a few times.\n\nVariety: 5\n\nThe best items from Wimbledon, such as its beautiful tickets or sweet merch, are awesome due to their prestige, not large number of options.\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 23\n\n9. Heavyweight title bouts\n\nNote: Unlike other sports, boxing obviously does not have an annual event to discuss, so for the purposes of these rankings, we are using heavyweight title fights as a single collectible event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorical Significance: 8\n\nThe lore of boxing weighs heavily on its collectibles, as the stories of the biggest names such as Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson are told through objects such as boxing gloves, robes and tickets.\n\nMerch: 2\n\nLook, it\u2019s cool to see some vintage T-shirts featuring the names of big fights, but there is really no discussion to be had here.\n\nPrice: 8\n\nNote to self: Do not use the phrase \u201cpunches above its weight\u201d on the golf category when boxing is still on the table.\n\nAli\u2019s \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d heavyweight championship belt is the seventh-most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold at $6.18 million, and other Ali pieces have routinely fetched well into the six figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough, much like with Jordan and the NBA Finals, there is a bit of a chicken or the egg issue with Ali and the fights themselves, I am not taking away any credit here as Ali\u2019s name is on the billing.\n\nVariety: 4\n\nTickets, belts, robes, gloves, trunks, posters and not much else. Keeping in mind most of that will cost you at least as much as a car, with the exception of tickets, there is not a ton for the masses to work with on this.\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 22\n\n10. March Madness\n\nHistorical Significance: 8\n\nFew things spawn collectibility like an iconic moments, and few events create iconic moments like the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course Magic and Bird\u2019s face-off in 1979, and Michael Jordan\u2019s game-winner in 1982 immediately spring to mind, but unforgettable moments from less famous names such as Lorenzo Charles\u2019 buzzer-beater in 1983 are what really gives the tourney extra credit in the history department.\n\nMerch: 7\n\nThe Final Four logo is among the most iconic on this list, and for those who make the trek for the games each year, grabbing a shirt or hat is a far higher priority than your average event.\n\nPrice: 4\n\nTickets dominate the higher-end sales, for the most part due to the lack of availability of other pieces.\n\nThough jerseys and sneakers have sold \u2014 Christian Laettner has auctioned plenty of his memorabilia, including his jersey from \u201cThe Shot\u201d in 1992 for nearly $120,000, that is a rarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason for this, in large part, is the limitations placed upon collegiate athletes for decades surrounding their ability to earn money from their own gear. Even with NIL, today players can only sell their memorabilia after they finish school, and still it has yet to become a regular occurrence.\n\nVariety: 2\n\nDue to the limitations of memorabilia hitting the market, options are far from plentiful.\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 21",

      "title": "Collegiate competitive dance: The best sport you\u2019ve never watched",
      "text": "It is no secret that sports are a beloved global pastime. 70% of Americans watch live sports. Soccer alone has 3.5 billion fans worldwide. After major games, school hallways, streets, and group chats are abuzz with what everyone just witnessed together. The highlight of my senior year of high school was every upperclassman packing into our commons, pulling up chairs and couches, and sitting on laps, all crowding around one TV to watch the 2022 World Cup. All this to say: people love sports, but why?\n\nSome people are born into a fanbase that ties them to a sport from birth. Personally, I have spent my entire life letting the Kansas City Chiefs determine my mood every Sunday from September to February.\n\nOthers get fired up over rivalries: Yankees v. Red Sox, Army v. Navy, FC Barcelona v. Real Madrid, the list goes on. And then there are the moments that people talk about for years, the once-in-a-generation players that expand the limits of what we think possible, and the stadium atmospheres that you can feel in your body. But above all, the reason that we love sports is the stories. The \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d isn\u2019t talked about forty years later because we just really love hockey. It\u2019s because of the incredible American underdog triumph. We love heroes and villains, Davids and Goliaths, and moments that change everything.\n\nThere is a sport that has every single one of these aspects, and yet, only a fraction of the support: collegiate competitive dance. As a former competitive dancer, I have known about the secret world of dance for years. Every competition season my coaches forced me to watch Universal Dance Association (UDA) Nationals\u2014the national college dance team competition\u2014and soak in every last detail of each dance. Though at times I dreaded this practice because it meant an eventual lecture about \u201cbeing elite\u201d like them, I am glad that my eyes were opened to the world of competitive dance.\n\nCompetitive dance has all of the characteristics that make sports so beloved. Every nationals season, it is a competition between dance powerhouses Ohio State and the University of Minnesota over who will win in the two most coveted titles of the competition: jazz\u2014the classic, wide-ranging style of dance\u2014and pom\u2014a highly technical, sharp, cheer-influenced style with pom poms. In those categories of Division I-A (the level that large, Division I state schools compete in), almost any team that is not those two is the underdog.\n\nI believe that the best example of this is the Louisiana State University Tiger Girls in 2022. Dance is not recognized as a sport by the NCAA. So, while most dancers at a Division I school must maintain Division I GPA and practice standards due to university expectations, they are not protected by Title IX. Without this, they lack the equal opportunity to financial access offered to sports teams, along with other protections. Dance teams must typically fundraise and pay out of pocket for their equipment and ability to travel. Additionally, dance teams are left much more to the whims of the universities.\n\nThis was evident for the LSU Dance Team in 2021. The Tiger Girls, like most dance teams, performed on the sidelines of most major sporting events, including every football and basketball game. Since LSU belongs to the SEC conference\u2014where sports are a dominant part of university culture\u2014this demands an intense commitment.\n\nDance and cheer teams are typically the unrecognized ambassadors for entire schools, posing for photos and talking to families, alumni, and kids. Dancers must be up hours before the game to put on a full face of makeup, hair, outfits, and poms and be ready when the first fan arrives.\n\nThroughout the entire warmup and game, while the players can take breaks and enjoy moments of privacy, dancers must maintain a smile on their face. At a school like LSU, whose stadium holds over 100,000 people, the pressure to be \u201con\u201d from the time they enter the stadium until they go home is immense, and dancers are trained impeccably to never break.\n\nIn 2021, as in every year before, the LSU Tiger Girls did their duty and performed at every single one of LSU\u2019s football and basketball games. For context, the average dance team season includes 13 football games, over 50 basketball games, and nearly 70 community appearances. However, when the time came for them to shine (aka by going to UDA Nationals, which is the only competition all season), they were told they could not go.\n\nUDA Nationals is the only event that centers dance teams. Most dancers, myself included, will tell you that they perform on the sidelines as a necessity that allows them to compete. Competition is the priority.\n\nWhen the Tiger Girls were told they could not go to Nationals, they were devastated. They were given multiple reasons that they could not go, but ultimately it came down to the fact that the school prioritized NCAA recognized sports. It would be remiss not to point out the obvious sexism: dancers perform most at male sports games, while the vast majority of dance teams are female. There was no arguing; the Tiger Girls were not allowed to go to Orlando for UDA.\n\nSo, when they made it back in 2022, they had something to prove. They debuted a risky hip-hop routine that was all technique and no tricks, a completely different style from typical UDA hip-hop. And the song choice had a very pointed message: it was \u201cLike a Boy\u201d by Ciara. The team was taking a stand at how they were treated the previous year, calling out the double standard of LSU and the NCAA. With this dance, something magical happened. The entire competition wanted them to win. Even their competitors wanted an LSU victory.\n\nAnd they did. Dancers around the country, including myself, who resonated with the message of being forced to look pretty on the sideline of a men\u2019s game while receiving no recognition, watched the dance in awe. The Tiger Girls became an inspiration and an institution for dancers everywhere.\n\nWhile the dance went viral on TikTok, little change has actually happened. Coaches from across the nation at top schools like Minnesota, Harvard, and Rutgers are calling for recognition but dance is still not recognized by the NCAA. Most people have still never heard of UDA or consider dance as a sport. Dance teams across the country still perform on the sidelines every year while being barred from competing.\n\nSo what? Watch UDA Nationals! Even without a technical dance background, viewers can still enjoy and see just how impressive the dances are. Like all sports, the more you watch the more you understand what is going on. Soon, you will recognize the same rivalries, fanbases, major moments, underdogs, and stories that draw people into other sports are just as relevant in dance.\n\nLSU is not the only team with a comeback story; every year there are new teams to rally behind. Watching the competition shows the NCAA and universities just how much people care about these teams, which is the first step in gaining equal benefits. These dancers deserve to be treated equally, with equal funding and protections. The first step in doing so is letting universities know that they have eyes on them. People love rooting for the underdog, and there is no better underdog than competitive dance.",

      "text": "As maintaining leadership in space is a primary goal, particularly across the United States Space Force, NASA and other federal agencies, the U.S. remains focused on space exploration as a critical domain for missions, science investigation and national security.\n\nOne way to sustain a leading position is by achieving data dominance, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as machine learning (ML) algorithms onboard space missions to facilitate and enable real-time decision-making.\n\nThese technologies can be used for engineering analysis and opportunistic science measurements. Data analytics and ML algorithms can also optimize resources, prioritize data to send back to Earth and identify patterns promptly.\n\nThe goal of these strategies is to develop spacecraft capable of real-time situational analysis, enabling them to make autonomous decisions and further optimize space missions. Developing and achieving autonomous science and exploration spacecraft requires a fundamental shift in the approach to space exploration. And beyond that, space organizations must navigate several technical considerations to successfully implement this vision, including environmental constraints and adapting solutions for specific mission objectives.\n\nData-fueled space missions\n\nData analytics and ML algorithms are a driving force behind space missions. They can optimize resources, such as fuel and energy usage, assist in planning and scheduling processes of observation strategies for in-space telescopes and support the prioritization of the data to first send back to Earth.\n\nWhile ML algorithms on Earth can help identify patterns or correlations in massive datasets promptly, (Earth science mission teams are not scaling with the large amounts of data on hand) ML models onboard a spacecraft could help make missions even more efficient. A ML-enabled spacecraft on a life detection mission, for example, could analyze the data it gathers, identify the organic compound signatures in real-time and in the end prioritize other sampling locations without ground-in-the-loop intervention.\n\nA long-term goal of this approach would be to have in situ analysis with spacecraft operating and analyzing in real-time, making autonomous decisions that prioritize scientific goals without depending solely on Earth-based operations.\n\nImagine a spacecraft on Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, collecting data from the plumes being ejected at the south pole, then analyzing the data onboard and reprioritizing other operations without having to wait for a transmission from scientists on Earth \u2014 this could all be based on data collections using onboard AI-based models, software analysis and edge computing.\n\nWhile this onboard implementation would help make decisions in situ to optimize resources and scientific returns, several hurdles must be overcome to see this vision through for a more efficient future.\n\nSpace exploration: data and challenges\n\nOne primary challenge in implementing AI-enhanced spacecraft is the limited onboard computing power, constrained by strict power and weight limitations that make distributing power among communication, mobility, running onboard experiments, computing and much more a difficult balancing act. Also, the \u201cspace-proofing\u201d process \u2014 including thermal control, radiation shielding, and protection from meteoric and orbital debris complicates hardware development \u2014 and raises costs.\n\nBandwidth limitations and communication delays present another challenge in data transmission. Moreover, when the planetary target is not in Earth\u2019s direct line of sight, communication becomes entirely impossible with traditional spacecraft.\n\nOf all things, trusting the AI-driven strategy is a major challenge, particularly for life-detection missions. ML models are often seen as \u201cblack boxes,\u201d making it difficult for scientists to fully trust the appropriate algorithms\u2019 outcomes.\n\nEmbracing AI and ML in space exploration inspires true optimism and curiosity, and scientific discovery. To achieve this future, the industry must prioritize solutions like the development of hardware that allows real-time AI computations, advancement of data transmission tools and continuing investments in the Deep Space Network (DSN) to further enhance the efficiency of data transmission for missions.\n\nOne of the main difficulties is that the space industry must show that new hardware is truly impactful. Space missions rely on flight heritage \u2014 to prove that this new hardware works, industry needs a process to test and demonstrate tech that will have the new hardware onboard and show the success of the mission.\n\nThe testing of data-driven-enabled data prioritization must occur too \u2014 currently, space missions are designed to collect the amount of data that can be sent back to Earth. With AI-enhanced spacecraft, a fundamental shift can occur, as the ability to transmit data back to Earth will no longer be the significant bottleneck as data prioritization could be implemented.\n\nThe end goal is to collect as much data as the instrument onboard can, then have a smart algorithm onboard to prioritize the \u201cmost interesting\u201d data to send back to Earth. More opportunities to test algorithms onboard during simulation and on low-risk science missions will bolster solutions\u2019 technology readiness level.\n\nSpace missions have relied on pre-programmed instructions and extensive ground-in-the-loop analysis. This approach is a total change to the paradigm of space research and development, but becoming data-driven in space is necessary for success, especially when exploring targets farther away in our solar system.\n\nData-driven future\n\nPrivate sector collaboration is key to helping transform space missions \u2014 involving expert perspectives would provide innovative solutions and strategies to help space teams develop spacecraft that can process, transport and interpret critical data.\n\nThis collaboration could be leveraged to enable real-time AI computations directly onboard the spacecraft, while also enhancing data processing pipelines for operations teams, from data collection to prioritization. Moreover, this collaboration could help accelerate the development of AI processors for space applications, ensuring they remain radiation-proof and extremely power-efficient. These collaborations are already occurring, such as NASA and IBM\u2019s AI partnership.\n\nSpace agencies and the overall space industry must also implement an intelligent data collection solution, or data processing pipeline, that includes data collection, data labeling, analysis and then managing it appropriately so teams can access and make decisions in near real-time for mission-critical operations.\n\nData can also be leveraged in ML models for various applications, including anomaly detection, hardware failure prediction, and science data analysis. This can be done through training models on Earth and then fine-tuning them for specific space mission targets.\n\nUsing big data more effectively will also allow teams on Earth to develop visualization and simulation tools. These could involve digital twin investigations \u2014 virtual replicas of spacecraft and planetary environments to simulate missions and test algorithms before deployment \u2014 leading to smarter, more decisive actions for mission operations.\n\nCultivating a data-driven environment is not just about implementing next-gen tools, but it is a catalyst for the next frontier of space discovery and exploration.\n\nAdvancing AI-enhanced space exploration requires interdisciplinary collaboration (among AI experts, software engineers, astrobiologists and so forth) ensuring tools and models are adaptable and scalable. As computing power and onboard capabilities improve, data-intensive tasks (such as spectral analysis through ML) could increasingly be performed in space, to enable real-time insights and collaborative science discoveries, unlocking the next frontier of space exploration.\n\nVictoria Da Poian is Lead Data Scientist at Tyto Athene.\n\nEric Lyness is Lead Software Engineer at Tyto Athene.

      "title": "Virginia senators oppose Texas senators' proposed plan to move Space Shuttle Discovery",
      "text": "CHANTILLY, Va. \u2014 The Space Shuttle Discovery has been a prolific reminder of our nation\u2019s space exploration mission at the National Air & Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Fairfax County for 13 years. However, a couple of U.S. lawmakers want to continue its legacy at the Lone Star State instead.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas recently filed the \u201cBring the Space Shuttle Home Act\u201d to transfer the Discovery to its \u201crightful home\u201d at the NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\u201cIt is past time that the Space Center Houston Museum houses a space shuttle, given the unique relationship between the entire program and its support staff in Houston,\u201d said Sen. Cruz.\n\n\u201cHouston played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle program, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness when the Obama administration blocked the Space City from receiving the recognition it deserves,\u201d added Sen. Cornyn.\n\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum said it is aware of the proposal, but does not comment on pending legislation. A spokesperson said Discovery is a key piece of the National Collection.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia oppose moving the space shuttle.\n\nIn a statement, Kaine said, \u201cEvery year, millions of people visit the National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly to learn about aviation and space exploration and see exhibits like the Space Shuttle Discovery. Virginia has made significant contributions to aerospace development, and moving the Discovery to another location would be a significant waste of taxpayer resources.\u201d\n\nThe placement of Discovery has been a sensitive topic since the space shuttle was officially moved to the museum in 2012. It flew its final flight aboard a Boeing 747 to Dulles International Airport. A ceremony with astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, followed where Discovery was displayed nose-to-nose with Space Shuttle Enterprise.\n\nAmong the attendees were Mike Phillips and Stephan Schumm. Both men agree Discovery should stay with the Smithsonian.\n\n\u201cI agree that there should be a shuttle in Houston, but taking it out of the nation's capital and out of the best museum in the world isn't the answer,\u201d Phillips said.\n\n\u201cThe Air & Space Museum is the United States air museum and that's where I believe the shuttle belongs, especially that one,\u201d Schumm added.\n\nDiscovery was the third orbiter vehicle to fly in space. It flew 39 Earth-orbital missions, spent a total of 365 days in space and traveled almost 150 million miles.",

      "text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe next astronauts to fly to the moon now have a mission patch to represent their history-making journey.\n\nNASA on Thursday (April 3) debuted the official Artemis 2 insignia, its first emblem for a moon-bound crew in more than 50 years. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen will wear the patch when they launch on the Artemis 2 mission, currently targeted for no later than April 2026.\n\n\"This patch designates the mission as 'AII,' signifying not only the second major flight of the Artemis campaign, but also an endeavor of discovery that seeks to explore for all and by all,\" wrote the crew in their description of the mission patch.\n\nThe emblem includes design elements that symbolize the past, present and future of human space exploration.\n\nRelated: NASA's Artemis 2 mission: Everything you need to know\n\nBorrowing the same outline as NASA's Artemis program patch (as well as the shape of the \"A\" in \"AII\" and the red trajectory line forming the crossbar of the \"A\" and the path between Earth and the moon), the border frames an artistic depiction of \"Earthrise.\" The now-iconic image of our home planet hovering above the lunar horizon was captured by the Apollo 8 crew, the first humans to fly to the moon.\n\nThe Artemis 2 crew will not enter lunar orbit like Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders did in December 1968, but will share in seeing some of the same sights as they did while flying beyond the moon and then looping back to return to Earth.\n\n\"The scene of the Earth and the moon represents the dual nature of human spaceflight, both equally compelling,\" wrote the Artemis 2 astronauts. \"The moon represents our exploration destination, focused on discovery of the unknown. The Earth represents home, focused on the perspective we gain when we look back at our shared planet and learn what it is to be uniquely human.\"\n\nThe orbit depicted around Earth on the patch is intended to highlight the ongoing exploration missions that have enabled the Artemis program to set its sights on a long-term presence on the moon \"and soon, Mars.\"\n\nThe crew's surnames in the lower left corner of the patch complete the design.\n\nThe Artemis 2 insignia is absent any country flags, though red, white and blue are the prevalent colors on the otherwise black and gray patch. Mission commander Wiseman, pilot Glover and mission specialist Koch are American astronauts, while mission specialist Hansen is from Canada. He will be the first person from a nation other than the U.S. to fly to the moon.\n\nHansen, together with the Canadian Space Agency, earlier revealed his personal patch for the mission. It features Indigenous art as a sign of respect for Canada's original explorers.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n\u2014 The moon: Everything you need to know about Earth's companion\n\n\u2014 NASA's Artemis program: Everything you need to know\n\n\u2014 NASA stacks moon-bound Artemis 2 rocket: Space photo of the day\n\nIn addition to being humanity's first mission to the moon since 1972, the Artemis 2 mission will mark the first test flight of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket and Orion spacecraft with astronauts on board.\n\nWiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen will log more than 600,000 miles (965,000 kilometers) as they fly around the moon and back, including possibly traveling farther into space than any astronauts have flown before.",

      "text": "Francis Dinha is CEO and cofounder of OpenVPN Inc., a leading enterprise network security company.\n\nIn today's digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are no longer just an IT issue; they have evolved into a core business challenge that demands executive attention at the highest levels. The rapid rise of ransomware attacks, supply chain vulnerabilities and data breaches has created an environment of persistent uncertainty, leaving organizations grappling with how to stay resilient in the face of evolving threats. These incidents are no longer isolated; they have far-reaching implications that affect customer trust, operational efficiency and overall business continuity.\n\nHowever, forward-thinking CEOs are beginning to recognize that these disruptions, while formidable, also present unique opportunities to rethink their security strategies, innovate new solutions, and differentiate their organizations in an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace. By adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cybersecurity, leaders can transform threats into powerful catalysts for growth and long-term success. It takes resilience, determination and even panache\u2014but it can be done.\n\nFrom Crisis To Opportunity: A Leadership Imperative\n\nCyber threats often reveal vulnerabilities that were previously overlooked or underestimated. CEOs who adopt a proactive, opportunity-driven mindset can leverage these moments to:\n\n\u2022 Accelerate Digital Transformation: Cyber incidents often force companies to rethink their digital infrastructure. Rather than patching up outdated systems, visionary leaders use these disruptions as catalysts for comprehensive digital transformation. By investing in modern, scalable and secure architectures, businesses can enhance operational efficiency while improving resilience.\n\n\u2022 Enhance Customer Trust And Brand Reputation: A well-managed cybersecurity response can significantly boost customer trust. Transparency and swift action during a crisis signal to stakeholders that the organization values security and privacy. CEOs who take the lead in openly communicating security measures and improvements can turn a potential disaster into a loyalty-building exercise.\n\n\u2022 Innovate Security Offerings: Organizations that have experienced cyber disruptions often have firsthand knowledge of where existing security solutions fall short. Some companies have leveraged their experiences to develop proprietary security tools, creating new revenue streams and solidifying their position as industry leaders in cybersecurity.\n\nCase Studies: Turning Disruption Into Competitive Edge\n\nCase Study 1: Maersk - Strengthening Supply Chain Resilience\n\nIn 2017, global shipping giant Maersk fell victim to the NotPetya ransomware attack, which disrupted operations across 76 ports worldwide. Rather than viewing the incident solely as a setback, Maersk\u2019s leadership embarked on a strategic overhaul of its IT infrastructure. The company adopted the NIST framework, prioritized visibility and emerged as a global leader in supply chain cybersecurity resilience. The company\u2019s proactive stance now serves as a benchmark in the logistics industry.\n\nCase Study 2: Equifax - Rebuilding Through Transparency And Innovation\n\nAfter its highly publicized data breach in 2017, Equifax faced widespread criticism and regulatory scrutiny. However, under new leadership, the company took bold steps to regain trust by investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and launching new products focused on identity protection.

In response, the company\u2019s leadership took decisive action by rapidly deploying end-to-end encryption, hiring top cybersecurity experts and enhancing transparency around security practices. By addressing concerns head-on and demonstrating agility, Zoom maintained its competitive edge and strengthened its position in the enterprise market.\n\nKey Leadership Strategies For Cyber Disruption\n\nTo turn cybersecurity threats into opportunities, CEOs must embrace a multifaceted leadership approach that goes beyond technical solutions and extends to cultural, strategic and operational changes.\n\nFirst and foremost, fostering a security-first culture within an organization is critical. This means embedding cybersecurity considerations into every level of business decision-making, from product development to customer engagement. Leadership must set the tone by prioritizing security as a fundamental business value rather than a compliance checkbox. Building such a culture requires continuous reinforcement through regular training, internal communication and leading by example.\n\nEqually important is the need to invest in agility. In an environment where threats evolve rapidly, a rigid cybersecurity strategy can become obsolete overnight. CEOs must champion adaptive frameworks that allow businesses to quickly pivot in response to emerging risks. This could involve deploying flexible security architectures, implementing rapid-response teams, and fostering an internal culture that values experimentation and adaptability.\n\nAnother critical aspect of leadership in cybersecurity disruption is leveraging threat intelligence effectively. Staying ahead of adversaries requires access to real-time, actionable insights gathered from industry partners, regulatory bodies and cybersecurity experts. CEOs should advocate for partnerships and collaborations that enhance their organization\u2019s threat visibility, enabling proactive rather than reactive security measures.\n\nFinally, a forward-thinking CEO understands that technology is only as strong as the people who manage it. Prioritizing talent and training is crucial to building a resilient cybersecurity strategy. This involves not only hiring top cybersecurity professionals but also ensuring that every department is equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to recognize and respond to threats. Encouraging cross-functional collaboration and investing in ongoing education can create a more security-conscious workforce, reducing the likelihood of human error leading to breaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the face of rising cyber threats, CEOs who view disruption as an opportunity rather than a setback position their organizations for long-term success. By embracing innovation, transparency and proactive leadership, they can not only mitigate risks but also enhance their competitive standing in the market. The future of cybersecurity leadership lies in turning challenges into steppingstones for growth and transformation.",

      "title": "Breaking News: Kiteworks Unveils the Real Impact Behind 2024\u2019s Biggest Data Breaches",
      "text": "Share\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nEmail\n\nEvery year, cybersecurity watchers tally up the largest data breaches, typically ranked by the billions of records exposed or stolen. But what if the true cost of a breach isn\u2019t just in the numbers\u2014but in what those numbers actually mean?\n\nKiteworks, a leader in secure information exchange, aims to shift that conversation with the release of its \u201cTop 11 Data Breaches of 2024\u201d report. At the heart of this year\u2019s analysis is a new framework: the Risk Exposure Index (REI)\u2014a proprietary scoring model that redefines breach severity by focusing not just on scale, but on substance. Using a multidimensional approach that weighs data sensitivity, financial fallout, regulatory risk, attack sophistication, and more, the REI reveals a more nuanced and impactful view of cybersecurity threats.\n\nIn this exclusive TechBullion Q&A, Kiteworks vice president of corporate marketing and research, Patrick Spencer, unpacks the findings from the report, explore why what data is stolen now matters more than how much, and explain how businesses can use these insights to prioritize protection, secure their ecosystems, and stay ahead of 2025\u2019s emerging cyber risks.\n\nYour latest report introduces the Risk Exposure Index (REI). What makes this approach different from traditional breach severity rankings?\n\nThe Risk Exposure Index (REI) represents a significant advancement over traditional breach severity rankings by providing a multidimensional assessment framework rather than relying solely on record counts. While conventional approaches typically focus on the number of records exposed as the primary metric, the REI incorporates seven key weighted factors: number of records exposed (15%), financial impact estimation (20%), data sensitivity classification (20%), regulatory compliance implications (15%), ransomware involvement (10%), supply chain impact assessment (10%), and attack vector sophistication (10%). This comprehensive methodology normalizes each factor on a 1-10 scale to produce a final score ranging from 1 (minimal impact) to 10 (catastrophic impact), enabling more meaningful comparisons between diverse breach types. The report\u2019s analysis confirms this approach\u2019s value, showing that financial impact (r=0.84) and data sensitivity (r=0.78) correlate more strongly with actual breach severity than raw record counts (r=0.61), proving that what was stolen often matters more than how much was taken.\n\nOne of the key findings is that data sensitivity matters more than record count. Can you break down why that\u2019s such a game-changer?\n\nThe report\u2019s finding that data sensitivity outranks record count as the most influential factor (24% influence) in determining breach severity represents a profound shift in how we should evaluate cybersecurity incidents. This insight challenges the headline-grabbing focus on massive record counts and redirects attention to the actual harm potential of compromised information. The LoanDepot breach perfectly illustrates this principle\u2014despite affecting only 16.9 million records (relatively small compared to National Public Data\u2019s 2.9 billion), its exposure of highly sensitive financial documentation including tax returns and income verification earned it a higher risk score than several larger breaches containing less sensitive data. The report establishes a clear sensitivity hierarchy, with protected health information and financial documentation at the top, followed by payment details, Social Security numbers, and credentials. This finding should fundamentally reshape how organizations prioritize their security investments, suggesting they focus protective measures on their most sensitive data repositories rather than attempting to uniformly secure all information assets.\n\nHow did this insight play out in 2024\u2019s biggest breaches? Were there cases where fewer records were exposed but the impact was severe?\n\nThe supremacy of data sensitivity over record count was vividly demonstrated through several key breaches. The Change Healthcare incident stands as the most compelling example\u2014while affecting \u201conly\u201d 190 million records (significantly less than National Public Data\u2019s 2.9 billion), it earned the second-highest risk score (8.7) due to the extreme sensitivity of the compromised healthcare claims data and its catastrophic impact on the entire healthcare ecosystem. Similarly, the LoanDepot breach exposed just 16.9 million records but received a high risk score (7.6) because it contained highly sensitive financial documentation including tax returns and income verification. The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan breach (13.4 million records) and Dell Technologies breach (49 million records) further reinforce this pattern, with both receiving elevated risk scores (7.6 and 7.2 respectively) despite their relatively smaller scale, primarily due to the sensitive nature of the compromised information and regulatory implications. These cases definitively prove that what was stolen matters significantly more than how much was taken when measuring true breach severity.\n\nThe Change Healthcare breach received a perfect 10.0 for Supply Chain Impact. What made its effects so widespread?\n\nThe Change Healthcare breach stands as a textbook example of how a single vulnerability can cascade through an entire ecosystem, earning it a perfect 10.0 Supply Chain Impact score. As a critical infrastructure provider processing approximately 15 billion healthcare transactions annually and handling claims for one in three Americans, Change Healthcare\u2019s systems were deeply embedded in the operations of thousands of healthcare providers nationwide. When its claims processing infrastructure was completely shut down for 26 days, it triggered a healthcare payment crisis of unprecedented proportions. The cascading effects included disruption of cash flow for healthcare providers across the country, delayed patient care due to verification challenges, pharmacy processing interruptions affecting medication access, and administrative backlogs that persisted months after technical recovery. The breach demonstrated how supply chain dependencies create force multiplier effects, where the impact extends far beyond the directly compromised organization\u2014the initial $22 million ransom payment pales in comparison to the estimated $32.1 billion in total ecosystem impact, a ratio that underscores the amplification effect of supply chain breaches.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Public Data breach had the highest overall risk score. What specific factors drove its ranking?\n\nThe National Public Data breach earned the highest overall risk score (8.93) due to a perfect storm of critical risk factors. Most prominently, it exposed an unprecedented 2.9 billion records\u2014the largest data breach in history by volume\u2014earning a maximum score of 10.0 for records exposed. The financial impact was similarly catastrophic, estimated at over $10 billion, which includes direct costs of notification and credit monitoring services, plus indirect costs from business disruption and reputational damage that erased $3.8 billion in market capitalization in just one week. The breach also scored exceptionally high (9.5) on data sensitivity due to the compromise of Social Security numbers for approximately 1.1 billion individuals, along with home addresses, property ownership information, and other sensitive personal details. Additionally, its regulatory implications were severe (9.0), triggering investigations by the FTC, SEC, 47 state attorneys general, and European data protection authorities in 12 countries. The attack vector sophistication (8.4) was also remarkable, featuring \u201clow-and-slow\u201d API exploitation methods specifically designed to evade detection systems, allowing attackers to remain undetected for nine months.\n\nYour research also examines how breaches happen. What trends stood out in the sophistication of attack methods used in 2024?\n\nThe 2024 breach landscape revealed significant evolution in attack sophistication. Credential-based attacks remained the primary initial vector in 5 of 11 major breaches but evolved from generic phishing to advanced social engineering tactics like Dell\u2019s convincing partner impersonation and Kaiser\u2019s MFA fatigue techniques. The vulnerability exploitation window shortened dramatically, with Change Healthcare attacked just 16 days after patch release. Most concerning was the rise of \u201clow-and-slow\u201d methodologies, exemplified by National Public Data\u2019s breach where attackers maintained undetected access for nine months using sophisticated evasion techniques. The Ticketmaster breach showcased another trend\u2014combining zero-day exploitation with highly targeted actions focused on specific high-value systems. These patterns indicate threat actors are increasingly prioritizing stealth and precision over speed, conducting extensive reconnaissance to understand their targets\u2019 most valuable assets.\n\nRegulatory consequences factored heavily into your rankings. How are different industries handling the compliance challenges that follow major breaches?\n\nThe report reveals significant disparities in how industries handle post-breach regulatory challenges, with financial services and healthcare demonstrating the most mature response frameworks due to their established regulatory environments. Healthcare organizations like Change Healthcare and Kaiser face particularly complex scenarios under HIPAA, with UnitedHealth Group navigating both healthcare regulations and SEC disclosure requirements simultaneously. Financial institutions like LoanDepot contend with sector-specific obligations under GLBA alongside state privacy laws. The retail sector, exemplified by Hot Topic, struggles with the intersecting demands of PCI DSS compliance and consumer protection regulations. Organizations operating internationally, like Ticketmaster, face the most daunting compliance landscape, navigating requirements across dozens of jurisdictions with conflicting timelines and mandates. The report notes that entities subject to multiple regulatory regimes experienced 27% higher breach costs, yet regulation alone hasn\u2019t proven effective at preventing breaches, as regulated and less-regulated industries showed similar breach rates, suggesting compliance doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to better security.\n\nHealthcare and financial services consistently top breach impact lists. What systemic issues make them prime targets for cyberattacks?\n\nHealthcare and financial services consistently top breach impact lists due to several systemic vulnerabilities. Both industries store extraordinarily valuable data\u2014healthcare holds protected health information (ranked highest in data sensitivity), while financial institutions possess documentation enabling immediate monetization. Their complex digital ecosystems, often combining aging legacy infrastructure with modern cloud services, create expanded attack surfaces with security gaps. The report highlights how operational constraints delay critical security updates\u2014Change Healthcare was breached just 16 days after a patch release. Third-party dependencies amplify risks through interconnected vendor networks, as demonstrated by Kaiser Permanente\u2019s vendor breach. Finally, strict regulatory requirements paradoxically increase breach impact; while protecting consumers, they significantly raise post-breach costs through mandatory notifications, investigations, and penalties, explaining why these sectors experienced 27% higher breach costs.\n\nYour report highlights third-party risk as a growing concern. Why do organizations still struggle with securing vendor and partner ecosystems?\n\nOrganizations continue to struggle with third-party risk management despite its growing importance. The report identifies this as \u201cthe least mature security domain in 2024,\u201d with most vendor assessment programs remaining compliance-oriented rather than risk-based, using point-in-time questionnaires instead of continuous monitoring. The Change Healthcare breach illustrated this problem dramatically, receiving a perfect 10.0 Supply Chain Impact score when its compromise disrupted thousands of healthcare providers nationwide. Contract security requirements typically lack specificity and enforcement mechanisms, while incident response plans rarely account for multi-party scenarios. The report notes that 64% of major breaches exploited third-party vulnerabilities, proving security is only as strong as the weakest vendor. This gap persists because addressing it requires cross-organizational collaboration and governance models that clash with traditional security approaches focused primarily on organizational boundaries.\n\nFor businesses looking to reduce their exposure, what key takeaways from the report should they act on immediately?\n\nBusinesses should act immediately on these key takeaways: First, classify data by sensitivity and focus security on the most sensitive assets, as data sensitivity showed the strongest correlation (24%) to breach impact. Second, strengthen third-party risk management, as 64% of major breaches exploited supply chain vulnerabilities. Third, accelerate vulnerability patching, particularly for customer-facing systems, with the Change Healthcare breach demonstrating exploitation just 16 days after patch release. Fourth, enhance credential security with phishing-resistant authentication, as credential attacks remained the initial vector in nearly half of major breaches. Finally, develop incident response plans that prioritize business continuity, particularly for ransomware scenarios where operational impact correlation (r=0.76) significantly exceeds general risk correlation (r=0.47).\n\nBeyond short-term fixes, how can organizations use the Risk Exposure Index to guide long-term cybersecurity investments?\n\nOrganizations can leverage the Risk Exposure Index for strategic long-term cybersecurity investments by using its weighted factor analysis to align security spending with actual breach impact drivers. Rather than spreading resources evenly, they should prioritize protecting their most sensitive data repositories (24% influence on risk score), focus on reducing potential financial impact through segmentation and resilience (22% influence), and strategically address regulatory compliance through automated frameworks (18% influence). The REI\u2019s correlation findings should guide architecture decisions\u2014with data sensitivity mattering more than volume, organizations might consolidate sensitive data into highly secure environments while distributing less sensitive information. Supply chain impact scores should inform vendor management strategies, particularly for critical service providers like Change Healthcare whose compromise received a perfect 10.0 score. Finally, the REI provides a common risk language that enables security leaders to communicate investment priorities to boards and executives in terms of measurable risk reduction rather than technical capabilities.\n\nWith 61% of breaches involving third-party interactions, how does Kiteworks Private Data Network (PDN) mitigate the risk of vendor and partner ecosystems, especially in highly regulated industries?\n\nKiteworks Private Data Network (PDN) addresses the critical third-party risk challenge highlighted in the report by creating a secure, controlled environment for all sensitive data exchanges. Given that 64% of major breaches exploited supply chain vulnerabilities, PDN\u2019s unified approach provides significant advantages, particularly for highly regulated industries. The platform establishes a security boundary that extends beyond organizational perimeters to encompass the entire digital supply chain, replacing the fragmented third-party connections that led to breaches like Change Healthcare\u2019s (which received a perfect 10.0 Supply Chain Impact score). For regulated industries like healthcare and financial services, which experienced 27% higher breach costs due to compliance requirements, PDN\u2019s comprehensive tracking, governance, and compliance capabilities ensure that all data exchanges meet regulatory standards regardless of the partner involved. By unifying visibility and control across all sensitive data movements, PDN addresses the report\u2019s finding that third-party risk management remains \u201cthe least mature security domain in 2024,\u201d converting a significant vulnerability into a manageable risk.\n\nLooking ahead, what cyber threats and vulnerabilities should businesses be preparing for in 2025 based on your latest findings?\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, businesses should prepare for more sophisticated third-party and supply chain attacks as threat actors recognize these remain the least mature security domain. The report\u2019s finding that 64% of major breaches exploited these relationships suggests attackers will continue targeting the weakest links in interconnected ecosystems. We\u2019ll likely see more incidents resembling the Change Healthcare breach, where compromise of a single service provider created catastrophic cascading effects across an entire industry. AI-related vulnerabilities present a growing concern on two fronts: first, as organizations integrate generative AI into their operations, potential data leakage through these systems creates new exfiltration vectors; second, AI-powered attacks will become more prevalent, with threat actors leveraging machine learning to create more convincing social engineering schemes or to identify and exploit vulnerabilities faster than organizations can patch them. The diminishing window between patch release and exploitation (just 16 days in the Change Healthcare breach) will likely shrink further, making rapid vulnerability management an even greater priority.",

      "title": "How Businesses Can Defend Against Automated Cybersecurity Threats",
      "text": "Rafael Umann, CEO and Founder at Azion.\n\nThe widespread adoption of AI has revolutionized how cyber threats are created and executed. Traditional security methods, such as signature-based antivirus solutions, rule-based intrusion detection systems and perimeter firewalls, are no longer sufficient. Businesses must adopt a proactive cybersecurity approach to identify and neutralize risks before they cause damage.\n\nDespite this scenario, as the World Economic Forum's latest Global Cybersecurity Outlook reports, \"While 66% of organizations expect AI to have the most significant impact on cybersecurity in the year to come, only 37% report having processes in place to assess the security of AI tools before deployment.\"\n\nI'll explore key strategies for strengthening your defenses against AI-driven cyber threats and how adopting advanced security measures can help mitigate compliance and data protection risks.\n\nThe Main AI-Driven Threats Today\n\nAI has taken social engineering to a new level, using deep learning to create highly realistic phishing content, including deepfake impersonations, making them a significant cyber threat. AI has also upgraded well-known attacks such as advanced malware and autonomous botnets.\n\nModern malware introduces a new level of complexity: It's self-learning and adaptive. It can change its real-time behaviors to avoid security solutions, resulting in polymorphic malware (changing its signature with each execution), fileless attacks (operating within system memory, evading signature-based detection) and AI-assisted brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks (cracking passwords and authentication mechanisms more efficiently).\n\nIn the same way, botnets have become significantly more dangerous, conducting intelligent DDoS attacks, identifying and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities and evading detection using AI-enhanced traffic masking, continuously adapting their attack patterns to maximize disruption.\n\nBesides security implications, all of this increases compliance risks. Non-compliance with GDPR, CCPA and PCI DSS can result in regulatory fines, legal consequences, loss of customer trust, reputational damage and operational disruptions.\n\nHow To Mitigate Security And Compliance Risk\n\nAs mentioned, the consequences of cyber threats extend beyond financial losses. In this context, outdated traditional approaches affect innovation, agility and visibility, leaving organizations vulnerable to cyber threats.\n\nA modern cybersecurity strategy requires a multilayered, AI-powered defense system that can dynamically evolve to neutralize emerging threats. This approach must be adaptable, programmable and autonomous. It includes automation, behavioral analysis and real-time mitigation to proactively defend against sophisticated attacks while maintaining compliance with global industry standards.\n\nProgrammable Security\n\nProgrammable security uses customizable policies to quickly and accurately respond to new threats, reducing human error and ensuring consistent enforcement.\n\nLeading companies are implementing programmable security solutions that evolve with emerging threats. For example, in e-commerce, machine learning systems automatically update reputation lists to block attacks and fraud while maintaining seamless customer experiences. Financial institutions employ customized fraud prevention policies that adjust based on risk factors, significantly reducing false positives.\n\nThese programmable approaches allow security policies to adapt automatically, creating highly efficient and responsive defense systems tailored to evolving threats. Integrating security policies with SIEMs and API gateways also provides for real-time threat detection and response, improving threat detection and response times.\n\nAdaptable Security\n\nAdaptable security provides businesses with a dynamic, real-time defense mechanism that improves over time and responds with precision to complex, fast-moving attacks, continuously learning and adjusting to emerging risks in real time. By analyzing vast amounts of data and user behavior, AI-driven systems can identify suspicious activities, from fraudulent transactions to insider threats, and respond immediately to mitigate them.\n\nThis self-learning capability enables businesses to stay ahead of emerging threats rather than merely reacting to known attack patterns, making it possible to anticipate threats based on evolving patterns and neutralize risks before they can impact business operations. Behavioral analysis further enhances this approach, as it detects anomalies that indicate potential security incidents, offering deeper insights into the true nature of a threat.\n\nAdaptive security frameworks are revolutionizing enterprise defense by learning from and responding to changing threat landscapes. AI technologies create unique behavioral fingerprints distinguishing legitimate users and sophisticated bots. Organizations are also deploying predictive systems that map digital attack surfaces and anticipate vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.\n\nAutonomous Security\n\nImplementing autonomous security enables acting in real time, automatically mitigating threats without human intervention. It reduces response times and minimizes risks, ensuring businesses can swiftly address potential breaches before they escalate. By continuously analyzing network traffic, user behavior and system anomalies, AI-powered security solutions can identify and neutralize threats faster and more efficiently than manual methods.\n\nIn conjunction with an autonomous response, zero-trust architecture maintains security across dynamic, multicloud environments by verifying every user and device before granting access, eliminating trust assumptions, and adding protection.\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to Capgemini Research Institute, GenAI-related security breaches affected 97% of organizations in 2024. These new AI-driven cyber threats demand a transition from traditional, static security models to integrated AI-powered solutions that are intelligent, proactive and autonomous. These advanced defenses can continuously adapt to new threats, enforce programmable policies and automate real-time mitigation.\n\nBy implementing adaptable, programmable and autonomous security strategies, organizations can strengthen their ability to detect, prevent and neutralize sophisticated attacks while ensuring compliance with industry regulations. Investing in AI-driven cybersecurity is fundamental to safeguarding business continuity, protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust in an increasingly digital world.",

      "title": "Top Data Breaches of March 2025",
      "text": "Cyber threats continue to challenge organizations in 2025, and March saw its share of major breaches. From cloud providers to universities, sensitive data was exposed, raising concerns about security gaps and regulatory risks.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the key incidents, what they reveal about emerging threats, and how organizations can strengthen their security.\n\n1. Oracle Cloud Data Breach\n\nA significant data breach allegedly affecting Oracle Cloud, with approximately six million records compromised, was reported this month. The threat actor, identified as \u201crose87168,\u201d claims to have exfiltrated sensitive data from Oracle\u2019s Single Sign-On (SSO) and LDAP systems, including Java KeyStore (JKS) files, encrypted passwords, key files, and Java Process Status (JPS) keys.\n\nThis incident is being described as one of the most impactful supply chain attacks of the year, potentially affecting over 140,000 Oracle Cloud tenants. The attacker has reportedly sought assistance in decrypting the stolen data and is demanding payment from affected organizations in exchange for deleting their records.\n\nOracle has officially denied the breach, stating that its cloud infrastructure remains secure and that the credentials being circulated do not belong to its systems. Despite this, multiple cybersecurity researchers and some Oracle customers have confirmed the authenticity of sample data shared by the attacker, raising concerns about the veracity of Oracle\u2019s denial.\n\nGiven the conflicting narratives, organizations relying on Oracle Cloud services are advised to take precautionary steps such as rotating passwords and keys, auditing logs for suspicious activity, and strengthening access controls through multi-factor authentication. As the situation unfolds, staying informed through official channels and security advisories is critical.\n\n2. New York University (NYU) Data Breach\n\nNew York University (NYU) experienced a major data breach that exposed the personal information of over 3 million applicants. On March 22, a hacker took control of the university\u2019s official website, replacing the homepage with charts displaying SAT and ACT scores, GPAs, and demographic data categorized by race.\n\nThe defaced page included a message accusing NYU of continuing to use race-based affirmative action practices, despite the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that declared such practices unconstitutional.\n\nThe individual behind the breach, using the handle @bestn-gy on X (formerly Twitter), claimed responsibility and stated that the data was sourced from NYU\u2019s internal data warehouse. The hacker also alleged involvement in a previous 2023 breach at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe information leaked from NYU included names, test scores, intended majors, zip codes, family backgrounds, and financial aid details, with records dating as far back as 1989.\n\nNYU\u2019s IT team acted swiftly, restoring the website within approximately two hours and notifying law enforcement. The university is currently investigating the breach and enhancing its cybersecurity infrastructure to prevent future incidents. In the aftermath, a class-action lawsuit has been filed against NYU, alleging negligence in protecting sensitive applicant data.\n\nThe incident has sparked broader concerns about data security in academic institutions and underscores the need for stronger cybersecurity practices across the education sector.\n\n3. SpyX Stalkerware Data Breach\n\nThe stalkerware app SpyX, marketed as a parental monitoring tool, recently suffered a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 2 million individuals, including thousands of Apple users. The breach revealed highly sensitive data, such as approximately 17,000 iCloud usernames and passwords stored in plaintext, along with email addresses, IP addresses, and device information. In some cases, logs of victims\u2019 activities, including messages and photos, were also exposed.\n\nThis breach is especially alarming because stalkerware apps like SpyX are often used for covert surveillance rather than legitimate parental oversight. While these apps claim to help monitor children, they can easily be misused to spy on partners, employees, or unsuspecting individuals, raising serious ethical and legal concerns.\n\nThe discovery was made by cybersecurity researchers from DDoSecrets and TechCrunch, who found unsecured backend data during their investigation.\n\nThe incident highlights not only the privacy violations caused by such spyware tools but also the security risks they pose to everyone involved, including those who use them.\n\nWith this breach, victims are now at increased risk of identity theft, account compromise, and further privacy invasion. It\u2019s a strong reminder of the need for stricter regulation and enforcement against stalkerware, which continues to operate in a gray area with devastating consequences.\n\n4. Jaguar Land Rover Suffers Major Data Breach\n\nJaguar Land Rover (JLR) reportedly suffered a data breach in March 2025, with a hacker named \u201cRey\u201d claiming to have exposed 700 internal documents. The leaked data includes development logs, source code, tracking data, and employee credentials. The breach allegedly stemmed from compromised Jira credentials, likely obtained via infostealer malware, similar to tactics used by the HELLCAT ransomware group.\n\nThis leak raises concerns over intellectual property theft, employee privacy, and competitive risks. JLR has yet to comment, but the incident highlights the need for stronger security measures like MFA, credential rotation, and continuous monitoring.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis month showed how easily security gaps can lead to serious data breaches. Weak credentials, unsecured databases, and supply chain risks were common factors across incidents. These breaches reinforce the need for stronger authentication, better access controls, and continuous monitoring. Organizations that take proactive steps will be in a better position to prevent and respond to future threats.\n\nRelated Reads:\n\nTop Data Breaches of February 2025\n\nTop Data Breaches of January 2025\n\nTop Data Breaches in December 2024\n\nMajor Data Breaches of November 2024\n\nMajor Data Breaches of October 2024\n\nThe post Top Data Breaches of March 2025 appeared first on Strobes Security.",

      "title": "Cybersecurity for Businesses in PNG: Protecting Your Data and Reputation",
      "text": "By Brown Bolzy Gari\n\nIn today\u2019s digital world, cybersecurity is no longer just an IT issue\u2014it is a business survival issue. Companies in Papua New Guinea (PNG), from small businesses to large corporations, are increasingly being targeted by cybercriminals.\n\nWith the rise of online banking, digital payments, and cloud storage, businesses handle more sensitive customer and financial data than ever before. Unfortunately, many PNG businesses lack strong security measures, making them easy targets for hackers, data breaches, and financial fraud.\n\nA single cyberattack can lead to financial loss, damage to customer trust, and even legal consequences. So, how can PNG businesses protect themselves from cyber threats?\n\n1. The Biggest Cyber Threats to Businesses in PNG\n\n? Phishing Attacks\n\nPhishing is one of the most common cyber threats. Hackers send fake emails or messages pretending to be banks, government agencies, or business partners. These messages trick employees into sharing login details or financial information.\n\nExample: An employee receives an email that looks like it\u2019s from their bank, asking them to \u201cverify\u201d their account by clicking a link. If they do, hackers steal their login details.\n\n? Ransomware Attacks\n\nRansomware is a type of malware that locks a company\u2019s files until a ransom is paid. Many businesses pay the ransom but never get their data back.\n\nExample: A PNG business loses access to all its customer records after an employee opens an infected email attachment. Hackers demand payment in cryptocurrency to unlock the files.\n\n? Data Breaches\n\nWeak security measures allow hackers to steal customer information, such as credit card details, personal IDs, and business secrets. Data breaches can lead to lawsuits and loss of customer trust.\n\nExample: A retail store\u2019s unsecured database is hacked, exposing customers\u2019 credit card information.\n\n? Insider Threats\n\nSometimes, employees or former staff leak or misuse sensitive company data\u2014either by accident or intentionally.\n\nExample: A disgruntled employee shares confidential business files with a competitor before leaving the company.\n\n? Weak Passwords & Unprotected Systems\n\nMany businesses fail to update passwords and security settings, making it easy for hackers to break into company accounts.\n\nExample: A business uses \u201cpassword123\u201d for all its accounts, making it easy for hackers to gain access.\n\n2. How PNG Businesses Can Protect Themselves from Cyberattacks\n\n\u2705 Train Employees on Cybersecurity\n\nEducate staff on how to spot phishing emails, fake websites, and suspicious attachments.\n\nEncourage employees to report suspicious messages before clicking on links.\n\nConduct regular cybersecurity awareness training.\n\n\u2705 Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\nRequire strong, unique passwords (e.g., \u201cB1z@rre$ecureP@ss\u201d instead of \u201cpassword123\u201d).\n\nEnable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which requires an extra verification step (like a text message code) before logging in.\n\nRegularly update antivirus software, operating systems, and security patches to fix vulnerabilities.\n\nUse firewalls and encryption to protect business networks.\n\n\u2705 Back Up Important Business Data\n\nStore backups of critical data in a secure location (e.g., external hard drives or cloud storage).\n\nTest backups regularly to ensure they can be restored in case of a cyberattack.\n\n\u2705 Control Employee Access to Sensitive Information\n\nNot all employees should have access to financial records or customer data.\n\nLimit access based on job roles to reduce insider threats.\n\n\u2705 Secure Business Emails & Communications\n\nUse official company email accounts instead of free services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) for business transactions.\n\nBe cautious when sharing financial information\u2014always verify requests by phone first.\n\n\u2705 Develop a Cybersecurity Policy\n\nCreate a clear IT security policy for employees, outlining safe online practices.\n\nEstablish a cyber incident response plan so the business knows what to do if hacked.\n\n3. What to Do If Your Business is Hacked\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Disconnect affected devices from the internet to prevent further damage.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Report the attack to your IT team, bank, or a cybersecurity expert.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Notify affected customers if their data has been leaked (this builds trust and may be legally required).\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Investigate the breach to understand how it happened and strengthen security.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Avoid paying ransoms\u2014there\u2019s no guarantee hackers will return your data.\n\n4. Why Cybersecurity is Good for Business\n\n? Protects Customer Trust\n\nCustomers are more likely to do business with companies that keep their data safe. A single breach can destroy years of trust.\n\n? Prevents Financial Losses\n\nCyberattacks can cost businesses millions in recovery expenses, legal fees, and lost revenue.\n\n? Ensures Business Continuity\n\nA secure business can operate smoothly without disruption from hackers.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nCybercrime is a real and growing threat in Papua New Guinea. Businesses that fail to take cybersecurity seriously risk losing money, data, and customer trust.",

      "title": "How AI is Transforming the Fight Against Data Breaches",
      "text": "The average cost of a data breach surged to $4.88 million from $4.45 million in 2023, a 10% surge and the biggest increase since the pandemic, as per a report by IBM (Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024). To counter the rising impact, 2 out of 3 organizations are massively investing in AI to prevent attacks and automate their SOCs. The organizations reported that they achieved an average savings of $2.2 million in breach costs by using AI in their preventative process.\n\nThe ruinous financial and reputation impacts of a data breach\n\nThe most significant impact of poor data security has to do with the financial losses. In 2023, the average cost of data breaches reached a record-high global level of $4.45 million USD; for some regions, reached $9.44 million USD.\n\nData breaches severely impair a company\u2019s reputation and cause erosion in customer trust. According to a Forrester\u2019s Security Survey, 2023, 90% of U.S. consumers have expressed that vendor security issues could have adverse effects on their lives, while 60% indicated that they would be less likely to do business with brands that have experienced a data breach.\n\nMore so, organizations are continually being pressured to fully comply with the legal and regulatory necessities associated with data protection. Laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA impose strict conditions on how data should be collected, processed, and stored. Noncompliance can attract heavy fines. Based on CMS Law\u2019s GDPR Enforcement Tracker Report the total fines for GDPR in 2022 reached \u20ac1.69 billion which is substantially higher than it was in earlier years.\n\nA data breach can expose personal data such as social security numbers, health records, and financial information, leaving victims exposed to identity theft and financial fraud. Companies risk losing trade secrets and intellectual property, which impacts their ability to compete and innovate in the future.\n\nDevastating data breaches bring a company to its knees with costly downtime and recovery efforts as organizations race to bring back their systems and data. They can also impair employees\u2019 ability to access critical systems and data, fundamentally affecting productivity and overall efficiency.\n\nProtecting data breaches in public clouds\n\nHere is a quick review of key strategies and best practices for securing data in the cloud include the following:\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) is the backbone of your cloud security. Always adhere to the least privilege principle in which you give users and services the least authority necessary to complete their jobs while avoiding excessive privileges.\n\nData encryption of any data whether at rest on databases, object storage, or other services assures that should an unauthorized access happen, the data remains undecipherable as well.\n\nNetwork security imposes a strong security perimeter when you isolate your cloud resources inside VPCs and control network traffic through security groups and network access control lists (ACLs).\n\nCollecting and analyzing security logs from all cloud resources in a central location provides insight into the activity and helps identify possible security threats.\n\nVulnerability management regularly scans the cloud environment to identify vulnerabilities and remediate them in a timely manner.\n\nBackup and disaster recovery is vital for business continuity. Having a good backup strategy for your data and applications ensures you are able to recover information lost or systems that have experienced failures.\n\nSecurity automation helps in streamlining security tasks and is a big efficiency booster. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables one to automate provisioning and management of cloud resources in a way that enforces consistent security configurations with reduced risks of human error.\n\nCompliance and governance round up the tasks to ensure your cloud environment meets regulations. Enforcing and establishing security policies for your cloud environment provides a framework through which you can ensure safe operations and exhibit compliance with regulations.\n\nAdopting these safety measures and best practices can immensely widen the protection of your data on public cloud platforms.\n\nAI: Your Secret Weapon for Public Cloud Data Security\n\nAI is transforming the landscape of securing data on public clouds such as Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure. These public clouds use AI algorithms to analyze immense amounts of data to detect signals and anomalies which might indicate potentially harmful acts. AI Intrusion\n\nDetection Systems learn about normal traffic patterns on the network and detect anomalies. Furthermore, AI analyzes files and code to detect malware, inclusive of new and unknown variants, and detects phishing emails and websites by performing analyses on their content, URLs, and sender-related information.\n\nIn vulnerability management, AI scans for vulnerabilities on the cloud applications as well as the associated infrastructures. AI prioritizes the exploited vulnerability\u2019s degree and impact potential so that Security Administrations can focus on real issues of security. AI proactively strengthens security by predicting potential threats and vulnerabilities, allowing for preemptive measures.\n\nAI automates incident response processes such as isolating infected systems, blocking malicious traffic, and notifying security teams. It also automates security audits, ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations. AI automatically rehabilitates security threats, such as patrolling vulnerabilities or blocking malicious IP addresses.\n\nData Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions powered by AI now identify and protect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and personal identity information. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) uses AI to analyze user behavior in real-time and identifies anomalous activities that might indicate insider threats or compromised accounts.\n\nAI detects anomalous login attempts, allowing it to flag suspicious activity and potential account compromise, filtering out alternative workarounds. AI-enabled risk-based authentication allows AI to assess the risk for a login and provide more firm or looser criteria for meeting that risk, enabling a dynamic, constantly changing process for logins.\n\nMajor cloud providers offer a range of powerful security tools to help protect your data. Google Cloud, for example, provides the Security Command Center for threat detection, Google SecOps for security automation, and Cloud Armor for web application and API protection. AWS offers similar solutions with Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and Amazon Inspector, while Azure provides Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Security Center.\n\nThe advantages for AI in cloud security are overwhelming; it enhances threat detection, allowing identification and neutralization of threats that even traditional security tools fail to detect. It allows incidents to be concluded much faster because they are automated in incident response. AI reduces costs through automation in security matters and allowing a security team to concentrate on broader strategic initiatives. AI enables compliance because it can more consistently enforce security policy and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, data security is not merely an IT technical problem; it is a very vital business problem with serious ramification and AI-powered cloud security solutions can safeguard your organization\u2019s data in the public cloud. Data breaches pose a growing threat, with increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks leading to severe financial losses, reputational damage, and legal consequences. The arrival of AI is changing the way we protect sensitive data in the cloud. AI is revolutionizing cloud security. By excelling in threat detection, vulnerability management, and data protection, AI empowers organizations to significantly enhance their security posture and\n\nmitigate the risk of data breaches. As AI technology advances, we can expect even more robust security solutions for a safer cloud environment.\n\nAbout the Author",

      "title": "Massive cuts to Health and Human Services\u2019 workforce signal a dramatic shift in US health policy",
      "text": "On March 27, 2025, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. announced plans to dramatically transform the department. HHS is the umbrella agency responsible for pandemic preparedness, biomedical research, food safety and many other health-related activities.\n\nIn a video posted that afternoon, Kennedy said the cuts and reorganization to HHS aim to \u201cstreamline our agency\u201d and \u201cradically improve our quality of service\u201d by eliminating rampant waste and inefficiency. \u201cNo American is going to be left behind,\u201d the health secretary told the nation.\n\nAs a scholar of U.S. health and public health policy, I have written about administrative burdens that prevent many Americans from accessing benefits to which they are entitled, including those provided by HHS, like Medicaid.\n\nFew experts would deny that the federal bureaucracy can be inefficient and siloed. This includes HHS, and calls to restructure the agency are nothing new\n\nCombined with previous reductions, these cuts may achieve some limited short-term savings. However, the proposed changes dramatically alter U.S. health policy and research, and they may endanger important benefits and protections for many Americans. They may also have severe consequences for scientific progress. And as some policy experts have suggested, the poorly targeted cuts may increase inefficiencies and waste down the line.\n\nHealth and science in a big-budget agency\n\nHHS is tasked with providing a variety of public health and social services as well as fostering scientific advancement.\n\nOriginally established as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1953, HHS has seen substantial growth and transformation over time. Today, HHS is home to 28 divisions. Some of these are well known to many Americans, such as the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Others, such as the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and the Administration for Community Living, may fly under the radar for most people.\n\nWith an annual budget of roughly US$1.8 trillion, HHS is one of the largest federal spenders, accounting for more than 1 in 5 dollars of the federal budget.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, HHS\u2019s budget increased by almost 40%, with a 17% increase in staffing. However, 85% of that money is spent on 79 million Medicaid and 68 million Medicare beneficiaries. Put differently, most of HHS\u2019 spending goes directly to many Americans in the form of health benefits.\n\nA new direction for Health and Human Services\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the changes initiated at HHS by the second-term Trump administration are far-reaching. They involve both staffing cuts and substantial reorganization.\n\nPrior to the March 27 announcement, the administration had already cut thousands of positions from HHS by letting go probationary employees and offering buyouts for employees to voluntarily leave.\n\nNow, HHS is slated to lose another 10,000 workers. The latest cuts focus most heavily on a handful of agencies. The FDA will lose an additional 3,500 employees, and the NIH will lose 1,200. The CDC, where cuts are steepest, will lose 2,400 positions.\n\nIn all, the moves will reduce the HHS workforce by about 25%, from more than 82,000 to 62,000. These changes will provide savings of about $1.8 billion, or 0.1% of the HHS budget.\n\nAlong with these cuts comes a major reorganization that will eliminate 13 out of 28 offices and agencies, close five of the 10 regional offices, reshuffle existing divisions and establish a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America.\n\nIn his latest message, Kennedy noted that this HHS transformation would return the agency to its core mission: to \u201cenhance the health and well-being of all Americans\u201d. He also announced his intention to refocus HHS on his Make America Healthy Again priorities, which involve reducing chronic illness \u201cby focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water and the elimination of environmental toxins.\u201d\n\nHow HHS\u2019 new reality will affect Americans\n\nKennedy has said the HHS overhaul will not affect services to Americans. Given the magnitude of the cuts, this seems unlikely.\n\nHHS reaches into the lives of all Americans. Many have family members on Medicaid or Medicare, or know individuals with disabilities or those dealing with substance use disorder. Disasters may strike anywhere. Bird flu and measles outbreaks are unfolding in many parts of the country. Everyone relies on access to safe foods, drugs and vaccines.\n\nIn his announcement, the health secretary highlighted cuts to HHS support functions, such as information technology and human resources, as a way to reduce redundancies and inefficiencies. But scaling down and reorganizing these capacities will inevitably have implications for how well HHS employees will be able to fulfill their duties \u2013 at least temporarily. Kennedy acknowledged this as a \u201cpainful period\u201d for HHS.\n\nHowever, large-scale reductions and reorganizations inevitably lead to more systemic disruptions, delays and denials. It seems implausible that Americans seeking access to health care, help with HIV prevention or early education benefits such as Head Start, which are also administered by HHS, will not be affected. This is particularly the case when conceived rapidly and without transparent long-term planning.\n\nThese new cuts are also further exacerbated by the administration\u2019s previous slashes to public health funding for state and local governments. Given the crucial functions of HHS \u2013 from health coverage for vulnerable populations to pandemic preparedness and response \u2013 the American Public Health Association predicts the cuts will result in a rise in rates of disease and death.\n\nAlready, previous cuts at the FDA \u2013 the agency responsible for safe foods and drugs \u2013 have led to delays in product reviews.\n\nOverall, the likelihood of increasing access challenges for people seeking services or support as well as fewer protections and longer wait times seems high.\n\nA fundamental reshaping of American public health\n\nThe HHS restructuring should be viewed in a broader context. Since coming to office, the Trump administration has aggressively sought to reshape the U.S. public health agenda. This has included vast cuts to research funding as well as funding for state and local governments. The most recent cuts at HHS fit into the mold of rolling back protections and reshaping science.\n\nThe Trump administration has already announced plans to curtail the Affordable Care Act and roll back regulations that address everything from clean water to safe vaccines. State programs focused on health disparities have also been targeted.\n\nHHS-funded research has also been scaled back dramatically, with a long list of projects terminated in research areas touching on health disparities, women\u2019s and LGBTQ-related health issues, COVID-19 and long COVID, vaccine hesitancy and more.\n\nThe HHS reorganization also revamps two bodies within HHS, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, that are instrumental in improving U.S. health care and providing policy research. This change further diminishes the likelihood that health policy will be based on scientific evidence and raises the risk for more politicized decision-making about health.\n\nMore cuts are likely still to come. Medicaid, the program providing health coverage for low-income Americans, will be a particular target. The House of Representatives passed a budget resolution on Feb. 25 that allows up to $880 billion in cuts to the program.\n\nAll told, plans already announced and those expected to emerge in the future dramatically alter U.S. health policy and roll back substantial protections for Americans.\n\nA vision for deregulation\n\nRegulation has emerged as the most prolific source of policymaking over the last five decades, particularly for health policy. Given its vast responsibilities, HHS is one of the federal government\u2019s most prolific regulators. Vast cuts to the HHS workforce will likely curtail this capability, resulting in fewer regulatory protections for Americans.\n\nAt the same time, with fewer experienced administrators on staff, industry influence over regulatory decisions will likely only grow stronger. HHS will simply lack the substance and procedural expertise to act independently. More industry influence and fewer independent regulators to counter it will also further reduce attention to disparities and underserved populations.\n\nUltimately, the Trump administration\u2019s efforts may lead to a vastly different federal health policy \u2013 with fewer benefits, services and protections \u2013 than what Americans have become accustomed to in modern times.",

      "title": "How Recent Federal Policy Changes Are Shaping Managed Care Pharmacy",
      "text": "Ongoing shifts in federal legislative and regulatory policies are significantly impacting pharmacy practice, with particular focus on government funding, PBM reform, and healthcare reforms, according to a panel presentation at the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy's annual meeting (AMCP 2025).\n\nThe speakers provided an extensive overview of the major regulatory shifts that have occurred since AMCP 2024, including the changing presidential administration and new Congress, new legislative and executive efforts, and the preliminary impacts of big policy initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nCongress continues to be divided, with Republicans currently holding a slim House majority, a 53-47 Senate split, and struggling to pass legislation, relying instead on continuing resolutions (CRs) to maintain government operations. The most recent CR extended funding for 7 months, with HR 1968 preserving most programs at prior-year levels.2 A broader legislative package that included pharmacy benefit manager reform was ultimately scaled down due to congressional gridlock.\n\nThe speakers predict that PBM reform will remain a key focus, with bipartisan efforts aimed at banning spread pricing and de-linking PBM compensation from drug costs.1 The budget reconciliation process, which allows tax and spending-related legislation to pass with a simple majority, has seen differing proposals from the House and Senate. The House favors broader spending cuts, while the Senate takes a more conservative approach. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been tasked with identifying further reductions, though specifics remain uncertain.\n\nPotential Medicaid and Medicare reforms include site neutrality for Medicare Part B, adjustments to bad debt coverage, and the extension of sequestration policies. The expiration of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enhanced subsidies has led to discussions on eligibility restrictions and tax credit recaptures. Medicaid reform proposals seek to equalize payments for able-bodied adults, impose per capita spending caps, and implement work requirements. While these measures aim to control costs, concerns persist regarding coverage rates and administrative burdens. Additionally, reductions to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) floor could shift financial responsibilities to states, influencing Medicaid expansion efforts.\n\nAMCP\u2019s legislative priorities include the Access to Prescription Digital Therapeutics Act and the Medicaid Value-Based Purchasing for Patients Act. PBM reform bills, such as the Protecting Pharmacies and Medicaid Act and the Saving Seniors Money on Prescriptions Act, have gained bipartisan support due to their potential cost-saving benefits. Meanwhile, reforms to the 340B Drug Pricing Program focus on increasing transparency and preventing duplicate Medicaid discounts. The Protect 340B Act and Sustain 340B Act aim to safeguard the program while implementing targeted reforms, while the 340B Access Act seeks to ease participation for non-covered entities and Medicaid plans.\n\nRegulatory updates include key agency nominations, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr as HHS secretary, Marty Makary, MD, as FDA commissioner, and Janette Nesheiwat, MD, as surgeon general.3 The IRA\u2019s drug price negotiation process continues, with the second negotiation round concluding in November and the first set of negotiated prices taking effect in January 2026. Public engagement events are ongoing to solicit stakeholder input.\n\nOther regulatory shifts include CMS terminating several payment model trials, the administration rescinding prior guidance on gender-affirming care, and the HHS releasing a strategic plan for artificial intelligence in health care. However, the new administration\u2019s commitment to artificial intelligence initiatives remains uncertain.\n\nWith ongoing changes in health care policy, advocacy and stakeholder engagement remain essential. As legislative and regulatory landscapes evolve, staying informed and involved in policymaking will be critical for health care professionals navigating these developments.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

      "title": "Tim Walz and the Border That Would Still Be a Crisis",
      "text": "You might not have noticed, but Minnesota governor and losing 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz is on a national tour. He is holding town halls in congressional districts won by President Donald Trump in Iowa, Texas, Ohio, Wisconsin and more. Any time a national political figure schedules a visit to Iowa, there is speculation that he or she is going to run for president. But Tim Walz? Really?\n\nWalz told CNN Sunday that while he is considering a run for a third term as governor in 2026, \"I am not thinking about running in 2028.\" Parse that any way you like.\n\nWalz made a little news on the issue of former President Joe Biden's decision to run for reelection when he was clearly unable to mentally and physically handle the job. Walz blamed Biden himself -- \"He made the decision\" -- and then added, \"I would hope we would never do it again.\" Then, he changed the subject.\n\nOne eye-opening part of the interview was when Walz was asked about the Harris-Walz ticket's position on immigration and the disaster at the U.S.-Mexico border. His answer suggested that if Democrats had won the election last November, the problem at the border created by President Biden would have continued under President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"On immigration,\" Walz said, \"what we were asking for is a bipartisan policy that strengthens immigration control, that recognizes that we need a workforce here, that they should be allowed here legally, and that, when they get here, they're part of the American fabric.\"\n\nFrom that, it appears that Walz's border policy was to legalize the migrants who were crossing illegally during the Biden years, get them jobs and then make sure that they are \"part of the American fabric.\" At another point in the interview, Walz said, \"None of us are saying we should be soft on the border.\" But that sounds pretty soft on the border.\n\nWalz continued: \"I'm not going to say what we need to do is, we need to just arrest people and ship them to El Salvador. No, what we need to do, invest the money on the border. We need to make sure that we have the judges necessary to adjudicate things faster. We need to make sure, if you're going to be in this country here legally, when you are, you're going to be uplifted, celebrated and part of this great American tapestry. And that is the bipartisan bill we had.\"\n\nThat last part was a reference to legislation that Harris often claimed would fix the problems of thousands and thousands of migrants crossing the border every day and being allowed to stay in the United States. The bill, Harris said in many campaign appearances, would be the heart of her border and immigration policy. It never passed House or Senate votes, nor would it today if Walz and Harris were in the White House.\n\nBut what Walz's interview really brings to mind is the fact that if he and Harris had been elected, the border problem would still be with us. One of the remarkable things about the second Trump administration is how quickly Trump stopped the massive and destructive flow of illegal crossers over the border. The border crisis, once named in opinion polls as one of the nation's most pressing issues, virtually disappeared overnight.\n\n\"Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded,\" Trump said in his March address to a joint session of Congress. \"The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation: 'We must have legislation to secure the border.' But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.\"\n\nHe was right. Trump has, of course, since moved on to other issues and controversies. But with his discussion of the border, Walz gave us a deeply troubling glimpse of what might have been.\n\nByron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner.

      "text": "President Trump announced a plan on Friday to turn a narrow strip along the Mexican border in California, Arizona and New Mexico into a military installation as part of his effort to curtail illegal crossings.\n\nThe plan, set out in a White House memorandum, calls for transferring authority over the 60-foot-wide strip of federal border land known as the Roosevelt Reservation from other cabinet agencies to the Defense Department. Military forces patrolling that area could then temporarily detain migrants passing through for trespassing on a military reservation, said a U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.\n\nThe directive expands a military presence that has increased steadily along the southern border, even as crossings have already dropped precipitously during the Trump administration. The ordering of troops to the border has already put the military in politically charged territory, and, depending on the details of the effort, the plan could run afoul of laws that limit the use of regular federal troops for domestic law enforcement.\n\nThe directive says that the border strip will become a \u201cmilitary installation under the jurisdiction of\u201d the Pentagon. Military members would be able to stop anyone crossing into the \u201cmilitary installation\u201d but would not have the power to make immigration arrests, according to the military official. Border Patrol agents could then be summoned to arrest the migrants.\n\nThe memorandum formalizes a plan that the administration had been considering for weeks. The Washington Post had reported on the plan earlier.\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to questions seeking clarity as to what U.S. forces operating in the strip of border land would be able to do. A Defense Department spokesman also did not respond to questions seeking clarity.\n\nMilitary officials are still working out how to execute the plan, including how long troops could detain migrants before turning them over to Border Patrol agents, and what type of \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs needed to be installed along the border, warning migrants they were about to enter a U.S. military reservation.\n\nThen there are other logistics that would have to be hammered out, such as the languages the signs are written in, and how far apart they are posted. There is also the question of where to position military patrols along hundreds of miles of rugged land along the border, and what additional training those troops might need.\n\nAdam Isacson, who focuses on border security and human rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the memorandum appeared to create a path for using quasi-military personnel to detain migrants.",

      "title": "Vermont House advances education reform bill",
      "text": "MONTPELIER \u2014 In hope of making the state's education system more sustainable, the Vermont House of Representatives passed a major reform bill.\n\nH.454 \"marks a major step toward building a more equitable and student-centered public education system, and a more stable, resilient financing system,\" states an announcement from the Office of the Speaker of the House following the vote on the bill Friday. The bill moves on to the Senate now.\n\n\u201cI voted yes because the status quo is unacceptable for our kids, teachers and communities,\u201d House Speaker Rep. Jill Krowinski, D-Chittenden-16, said in the announcement. \u201cI know change is hard, but we must lead and create stability in our public education system.\"\n\nKey components of the bill, according to the announcement, include moving to a foundation funding model that gives school districts money based on the cost to educate a student; launching a statewide planning process to update and consolidate school district boundaries; establishing statewide class size minimums, shared calendars, data systems and shared resources between schools; creating clearer rules for the use of public tuition dollars; planning for long-term school construction investments and projects; and strengthening the State Board of Education to ensure transparent, accountable oversight with public input.\n\nRep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Windham-7, chairwoman of the House Committee on Ways and Means and Brattleboro resident, said the bill \"stabilizes and lowers property taxes, bends the cost curve and creates safe, consistent, quality education for all Vermont kids for a generation.\"\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t manage this in bits and pieces \u2014 we have tried to do that before,\" Kornheiser said in the announcement. \"This bill rips off the bandages, duct tape and bailing twine that have held our education and property tax system together over the last decade and builds a careful net to sustain our children and communities into the future.\"\n\nHouse Education Committee Chairman Peter Conlon, D-Addison-2, said the bill addresses Vermont's challenges and builds for a more stable future by moving it \"toward scale, creating statewide cohesion and support for our system.\" He called the legislation \"a positive step forward for our kids, educators and taxpayers.\u201d\n\nRep. Laura Sibilia, I-Windham-2, said she voted in support of the bill because it's \"comprehensive in nature, because it moves forward at an aggressive but accessible pace, and because it is set up in a way that anticipates and expects it will need to be adjusted.\"\n\n\"The consistent thing with big education bills in the Legislature is that they are emotional and always have aspects that everyone doesn\u2019t like \u2014 though it's not always the same thing,\" she said in her newsletter. \"In order to get anything done, legislative leaders and the governor have to work in a careful way to maintain enough support to enact changes.\"\n\nThe bill calls for the continuation of the Commission on the Future of Public Education's \"work with a sharper focus,\" according to the newsletter. A new subcommittee will propose three possible maps for school district boundaries by December, with an eye toward options that correspond with Vermont\u2019s geography, culture and school capacity.\n\nMinimum class sizes are envisioned to be 12 students in kindergarten, 15 in grades 1 to 4, and 18 in grades 5 to 12. Schools falling short of these numbers for two years in a row could face review by the State Board of Education. And middle and high schools would be expected to try to have at least 450 students total on average.\n\nAlso included in the bill is new support and aid for updating and modernizing school buildings, and waivers for schools unable to meet class size minimums due to geographic isolation.\n\nAt the beginning of the legislative session, Gov. Phil Scott proposed consolidating the state's 119 school districts into five and changing the education funding formula. While not a supporter of the bill, he expressed appreciation for \"the productive conversations we've had so far.\"\n\n\u201cThis bill is nowhere near perfect due to the cost, timeline and more,\" Scott said in a statement, preferring a quicker rollout. \"However, we all agree that education transformation is needed this session. In order to accomplish that, the passage of this imperfect bill by the House so it can move to the Senate is an important procedural step toward achieving that goal.\"\n\nHouse Republicans said they strongly opposed the legislation. They cited in their own announcement concerns over what they called \"a lack of transparency, fiscal responsibility and a slow timeline.\"\n\n\u201cWe remain hopeful that meaningful, bipartisan collaboration can still be achieved before the legislative session ends,\u201d House Republican Leader Pattie McCoy, R-Rutland-1, stated.\n\nUrgent action is needed to provide tax relief but the bill \"fails to address the systemic reforms necessary to alleviate the financial burden on families,\" Republicans said.\n\nRep. Michelle Bos-Lun, D-Windham-3, said she voted against the legislation to \"preserve rural schools in my community.\"\n\n\"I come from a rural community that will lose vital, small, wanted local schools, both public and independent, if this bill moves forward in its current form,\" she said on the House floor. \"School districts of at least 4,000 students will not solve our problems, but will result in a loss of local control and civic engagement, especially in rural communities.\"\n\nBos-Lun told the Reformer the plan for the commission is \"a good idea,\" and described the proposed financial reforms as being \"well designed and sensible.\" Minimal classes sizes will end up closing schools in rural communities and subjecting many children to long bus rides, she said.\n\n\"H.454 is not likely to reduce costs significantly, but the cost to our communities will be significant,\" she said on the House floor. \"Setting the stage to close small rural community schools while not addressing the main cost drivers in education spending: teacher health insurance costs and student mental health costs is prioritizing the wrong issues.\"\n\nThe Rural School Community Alliance, which counts Windham Southeast School District among its membership, also panned the plan. The group said it \"appreciates the effort lawmakers have made in recent weeks to respond to the many concerns raised by Vermonters about proposed changes to our public education system.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, despite some improvements, H.454 falls short of addressing the most critical issues facing our rural communities, and it remains deeply concerning in its implications for educational equity, local democracy and the well-being of our children,\" the alliance said in an announcement. \"It moves toward centralizing decision-making into fewer school boards with reduced local representation, which would separate communities from decisions that directly impact their children and their schools.\"\n\nThe alliance also worries the bill will \"drive rural school closures statewide\" due to the combination of larger districts, less representation, goals for minimum class and district size, without the protection of a vote of the town affected by closing.\n\n\"Vermonters asked for tax relief \u2014 not the dismantling of a public education system that generations have worked to build, centered around strong, local community schools,\" the alliance said. \"We believe there is a path forward to address education funding in Vermont, and we urge lawmakers to focus on funding reform. Governance reform must be thoughtful, inclusive and grounded in a commitment to educational equity and community voice. Our children and communities deserve nothing less.\"",

      "title": "President Trump Orders Closure of the Department of Education: What Schools and EdTech Companies Need to Know About FERPA",
      "text": "On March 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14242 directing the Secretary of Education \u201cto the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, [to] take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education[.]\u201d This long-expected but dramatic move has educational institutions and education technology (EdTech) vendors\u2014companies that provide services such as online homework, grade tracking, and teaching materials\u2014wondering what now happens to the millions of students\u2019 education records they maintain. More importantly for would-be brokers of student data, does the sudden disappearance of the main enforcer of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) make student data a gold mine or a minefield?\n\nQuick Hits\n\nFERPA is a federal law that sets out a number of requirements educational institutions that receive federal funding must meet for the protection of student educational records.\n\nA recent Executive Order diminishes the federal government\u2019s power to enforce FERPA, heightening concerns that EdTech vendors could use student education data in prohibited ways.\n\nHowever, vendors would do so at their own risk, as the legal landscape surrounding student education records requires compliance with more than just FERPA.\n\nWhat Is FERPA?\n\nFERPA requires educational institutions that receive federal funding to protect student educational records. FERPA applies to all public and private K-12 schools, as well as post-secondary educational institutions, that receive federal funding. Specifically, FERPA requires such educational institutions to: (i) obtain consent prior to releasing education records, (ii) permit parents and eligible students to access and correct their records, (iii) provide annual notice of rights, (iv) maintain reasonable measures to keep education records secure, and more.\n\nWhile FERPA does not apply directly to EdTech companies, vendors are typically required by their contracts with individual educational institutions to comply fully with FERPA\u2019s obligations and restrictions. FERPA does not contain a private right of action. Instead, aggrieved parents and eligible students can file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education, which investigates and enforces alleged violations. If the Department finds a FERPA violation, the relevant educational institution can be disciplined, up to and including the loss of federal funding.\n\nA Student Data Gold Mine \u2026\n\nThe Department has long been criticized for failing to adequately enforce FERPA. As of 2025, the Department has never imposed a financial penalty on an institution for violating FERPA, instead working with violators to achieve voluntary, monitored compliance. Many have expressed concerns that abolishing or substantially changing the structure of the Department could further erode the likelihood of strong FERPA enforcement at the federal level.\n\nThe prospect of a \u201cWild West\u201d environment in the absence of the Department of Education may have schools and EdTech vendors salivating at the prospect of buying, selling, sharing, using, or otherwise processing the data of the millions of students (and former students) in the United States. Student data is a treasure trove. According to a report issued by the International Trade Administration in 2020, the EdTech market was estimated to be worth $89.49 billion, and it is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19.9 percent until 2028.\n\nA FERPA exception already permits school officials to disclose education records to EdTech vendors if the vendor has a legitimate educational interest, the vendor is subject to the school\u2019s supervision, and the school contractually prohibits the vendor from further disclosure. However, a federal enforcement vacuum may encourage such vendors to think they can ignore the FERPA obligations to which they have agreed when processing student data. It may also encourage third parties, contractors, consultants, and other organizations that do not fit within this exception to think they can bypass FERPA entirely.\n\n\u2026 or a Regulatory Minefield?\n\nDespite the potential decrease in enforcement at the federal level, (1) the existence of other FERPA regulators, (2) bipartisan interest in reform, and (3) uncertainty regarding the extent of the Department\u2019s closure cut against any argument that FERPA compliance will be less important in the coming days.\n\nFirst, FERPA does not preempt state or local laws. The Executive Order even emphasizes returning \u201cauthority over education to the States and local communities.\u201d Nearly all states have enacted at least one state-level student privacy law that supplements FERPA with additional privacy safeguards. These will persist regardless of what happens federally. In California, for example, the Student Online Personal Information Protection Act prohibits the use of student data for targeted advertising. Many states, like Illinois, have transposed FERPA into state statutes. Other states, like Virginia, incorporate FERPA by reference, essentially making compliance a state requirement as well as a federal requirement. Keeping aware of state-level obligations is of paramount importance for both educational institutions and EdTech providers, especially because in some states, like Wyoming, civil actions for damages may be permitted under public records laws if parents or students are knowingly or intentionally denied the right to inspect public school records.\n\nMoreover, there appears to be a strong bipartisan interest in FERPA reform, with commentators associated with the current administration indicating that they support amending FERPA to facilitate enforcement in the Department\u2019s absence. These commentators have taken the position that \u201c[r]ather than preserving a failing federal system, a potential reorganization of the Department of Education presents a critical opportunity to \u2026 protect student data[.]\u201d Some interested parties have proposed a private right of action for FERPA violations, while others want to explore other avenues to fill in regulatory gaps in student privacy, including by transferring many of the Department of Education\u2019s responsibilities to other agencies.\n\nFinally, the true extent to which the Department will be shuttered remains to be seen, as full closure may require an act of Congress. And, it is vital to remember that FERPA is a federal law, not a Department of Education regulation. Therefore, even if the Department were to close entirely, that would not make FERPA liability vanish forever. FERPA would remain in effect, and a future administration may reinitiate enforcement.\n\nNext Steps\n\nDespite the potential closure of the Department of Education, schools and EdTech vendors that ignore FERPA\u2019s obligations regarding student data nevertheless face a number of continued risks. The Department has traditionally pursued only patterns of noncompliance and egregious violations, and ignoring FERPA over the next three and a half years could be construed as just that. Moreover, for EdTech vendors, FERPA noncompliance could give rise to breach of contract claims, while enforcement by other regulators may cause the school with which the EdTech vendor is working to lose funding\u2014and, by extension, risk the vendor missing payday. Businesses operating in the education space may want to remain mindful of the full breadth of their obligations and act accordingly, even as changes take place within the federal education (and EdTech) landscape.",

Gavin Newsom and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, teachers unions and several education groups have wasted no time in protesting Trump\u2019s actions. Despite the outrage, experts say a full shuttering of the department would bring much-needed changes to a bloated education system that spends over $10,000 per pupil with very little to show for it.\n\n\u201cAmerica is on the precipice of radical education reform and change, where we are empowering parents, and we\u2019re not empowering the bureaucrats anymore,\u201d Norton Rainey, CEO of ACE Scholarships, an organization that gives financial support to children so that they can attend the school of their choice, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re putting money into the hands of our children, not into administrators, and that\u2019s a good thing for America.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order is framed around \u201creturning education to parents and communities,\u201d and directs the Secretary of Education to \u201ctake all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\u201d\n\nThe department excused half of its employees March 11 while Secretary of Education Linda McMahon vowed to end the \u201cbureaucratic bloat\u201d of her department to fulfill Trump\u2019s mandate.\n\nMcMahon announced on March 3 that her department\u2019s \u201cfinal mission\u201d is \u201cto send education back to the states and empower all parents to choose an excellent education for their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican education can be the greatest in the world,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt ought not to be corrupted by political ideologies, special interests, and unjust discrimination. Parents, teachers, and students alike deserve better.\u201d\n\nThe main complaints surrounding the Department of Education, stemming from conservative and libertarian critics, is that the agency is unconstitutional, fails to deliver on the promises it makes and that is corrupted by left-wing ideology.\n\nThe taxpayer spends about $14,840 per pupil every year, according to figures from World Population Review, though educational achievement does not seem to be improving.\n\n\u201cIncreases in education spending do not produce student achievement,\u201d Johnathan Butcher, a senior research fellow for education policy at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in a statement provided to the DCNF. \u201cHow we use the spending matters far more \u2014 and since centralized policies will not meet the needs of a diverse study body nationwide, interest groups will claim that they need more money in order to make the programs work.\u201d\n\nNumerous reports regarding student test scores have revealed shocking declines in academic performance, one example being the Nation\u2019s Report Card released in January. Its 2024 data showed plummeting reading scores for fourth and eighth grade students and static math scores for students in both grades. The report stated that this was \u201ccompounding a decline in the nation\u2019s reading scores that started prior to the pandemic.\u201d\n\nTrump has championed the demise of the department for months, declaring that \u201cwe will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education\u201d while on the campaign trail in Wisconsin in September.\n\n\u201cClosing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them,\u201d Trump said during his speech accommodating his executive order signing on Thursday.\n\nThe Department of Education did not respond to the DCNF\u2019s multiple requests for comment.\n\n\u2018A Product Of Leftist Politics\u2019\n\nIn 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act, with the office officially established in 1980. Carter stated that though the primary responsibility for education falls to the \u201cstates, localities, and private institutions,\u201d the federal government \u201chas for too long failed to play its own supporting role in education as effectively as it could.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Education is a product of leftist politics from the late 1970s,\u201d Butcher continued. \u201cPresident Jimmy Carter negotiated with teacher unions about its creation, and it has since become a way for special interest groups to identify and claim funding streams from federal taxpayers.\u201d\n\nFederal education projects and grants were already being organized and doled out before the ED, though the department was created to \u201cimprove the coordination\u201d of these programs, as well as \u201csupplement and complement\u201d state efforts to improve education.\n\nThe office was contested by Republicans from the start, while in the Cato Institute\u2019s policy recommendations for the 108th congress, the think tank cited several Democrats that weren\u2019t fond of the idea, either. Democratic Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal went along with the plan out of \u201cnot wanting to embarrass the president,\u201d according to the handbook.\n\nThe libertarian think tank also pointed to one House Democrat that spoke to the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cThe idea of an Education Department is really a bad one,\u201d the anonymous House Democrat told the Journal\u2019s Al Hunt in 1979. \u201cBut it\u2019s NEA\u2019s [National Education Association] top priority. There are school teachers in every congressional district and most of us simply don\u2019t need the aggravation of taking them on.\u201d\n\nDuring his first State of the Union address in 1982, President Ronald Reagan called on Congress to eliminate both the Energy Department and the Education Department.\n\n\u201cThe budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major savings by dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education and by eliminating ineffective subsidies for business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u2018Gazillion-Dollar-Question\u2019\n\nLeading libertarian and conservative thought leaders at the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Manhattan Institute, the American Enterprise Institute the Center for Education Reform remain convinced that dissolving the ED will not diminish the quality of American education.\n\nImportant programs would continue and could even flourish if given more flexibility if their grants were provided \u201cin block grants to the states,\u201d Butcher argued.\n\n\u201cLikewise, student loans should be moved to another agency, and the main adjustment will be to whom or where students make payments,\u201d he continued.\n\nButcher\u2019s long-term vision for education is that \u201clocal schools and state departments of education will not have to keep navigating burdensome federal education regulations or \u2018dear colleague letters\u2019 that micromanage local school practices. And this will be one of the largest benefits from closing the federal agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not have the option to send our kids to public school because of a progressive agenda. It\u2019s not an option for a committed Christian family,\u201d Pam Costes, administrator of Spirit Christian Academy, a private school with an alternative education model referred to as a NAUMS inc. university model school, told the DCNF.\n\nThe institution is \u201ca [private] school that puts the parents into their rightful place,\u201d Costes said, though she is not against public school. Costes emphasized that the partnership between parents and the school are essential to the institution\u2019s model.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 shutdowns, the school looked to what other academic institutions were doing for guidance and that the school\u2019s leadership was \u201creally good about listening and letting people make their decisions about what they thought was for their family, and allow parents to make those decisions, rather than us,\u201d Costes said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t for sure know why some districts are really able to leverage their dollar to get greater growth for their students,\u201d Dr. Marguerite Roza, research professor and director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University, told the DCNF. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that some districts are really quite successful at leveraging their money and getting better outcomes than maybe some of their others.\u201d\n\nRoza agreed with Butcher\u2019s assessment that it is not the amount of funding that seems to make a difference, but how the funding is used. Edunomics has dedicated years of research to measuring states\u2019 return on investment. The professor pointed to several factors that might impact a state\u2019s return on investment, including differing work forces, certifications, \u201cappetite[s] for academics,\u201d poverty levels and pay structures.\n\nEdunomics documents the correlation between state funding and student outcomes, with some data showing that increased spending doesn\u2019t positively relate to increased academic achievement. However, some school districts in certain states within them do show a positive correlation.\n\nThe \u201cgazillion-dollar-question\u201d is why some states are more effective at converting their state or federal funding into academic success than others, and that it can\u2019t be attributed to any one factor, Roza said.\n\nThe professor emphasized that it is not necessarily a department that leads to improved education, but good policies. She pointed to former President George W. Bush\u2019s\u2019 \u2018No Child Left Behind\u2019 policy, which she said was \u201cwidely suspected to be responsible\u201d for \u201csome steady improvement in student outcomes,\u201d though other sources say that the policy was \u201ca failed experiment.\u201d\n\nThe policy triggered \u201cmore focus by states on getting the student outcomes,\u201d Roza argued. No Child Left Behind expired in 2009 but was later officially changed in 2015 to the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n\nA common critique of private schools is that they are not accessible to all students. Organizations like ACE Scholarships and the Commonwealth Foundation, a Pennsylvania-based think tank dedicated to expanding school choice and fighting government overreach, work to ensure that school choice options are available, even for low-income families.\n\n\u201cI think we as taxpayers need to ask ourselves what we are getting from the U.S. Department of Education,\u201d Rachel Langan, a senior education policy analyst at the Commonwealth Foundation, told the DCNF. \u201cWhat are we getting for all of those tax dollars and is there a better way for those dollars to be spent?\u201d\n\nLangan is a former public-school teacher and described herself as once \u201cvery pro-public education\u201d to the DCNF. She pointed to the COVID-19 shutdowns\u2019 effects on education as having changed her perspective.\n\nThe policy analyst noted that the \u201cCOVID crisis open[ed] the eyes of American parents as to the value they were receiving or not from their public schools.\u201d Langan pointed to the shutdowns as a catalyst for many parents to realize that education could be improved, that school choice options are a necessity and how confusion emerged among parents over funding.\n\n\u201cWhere is our money going?\u201d She asked.\n\nThe Commonwealth Foundation \u201cwould like to see a dollar amount attached to every child in Pennsylvania that would follow that student to the school of their choice, whether that\u2019s a public, private, homeschool, career, technical school or charter school,\u201d Langan continued.\n\nShe also referenced that in January, the think tank learned from a Right-to-Know request that there are about 50,000 students who applied for a tax credit scholarship in the state and did not receive one due to Pennsylvania\u2019s state program caps. \u201cThere\u2019s 50,000 kids whose families want something better for them who applied for scholarship but because of program caps, they didn\u2019t receive it,\u201d she said.\n\nACE Scholarships also provides K-12 scholarships to lower-income children. The organization also collaborates with state legislatures to advocate for school choice policies.\n\n\u201cOur belief at ACE is that school choice works,\u201d Rainey told the DCNF. He also noted that ACE financially supports children with partial tuition scholarships for up to $4,000 annually, and that a child\u2019s quality education prepares kids for the \u201cAmerican dream.\u201d\n\nRainey said that at ACE, they believe every child \u201cshould experience the American dream. And we think that it really does begin with education, but sadly, as we all know and we lament about this, our country is not providing the American Dream for too many kids. They\u2019re being left behind. They\u2019re not being educated.\u201d\n\nRainey pointed to some \u201cexciting\u201d upcoming changes in education, including Texas\u2019 proposed education savings account bill and Trump\u2019s federal tax cut initiative.\n\n\u201cWe believe that when you invest in kids, great things will happen, and that when you change education, that you\u2019re changing everything in their lives,\u201d he said.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: PatrickRich/Creative Commons, Public Domain)",

      "title": "Schools reform plan trimmed after threats of major cuts",
      "text": "It was one of the first issues to surface this year, and one of the last to be resolved, but lawmakers Monday approved compromise legislation to trim the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future while keeping much of the multiyear plan intact.\n\nThe Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act passed Monday evening on largely party-line votes in the House and Senate. It delays implementation of \u201ccollaborative time,\u201d preserves funding for community schools and protects students in poverty, those in special education and those in classes for non-English speakers from any potential per pupil funding cuts.\n\n\u201cThese are the students who really need help with the Blueprint. There is no pause, cut in funding whatsoever,\u201d said Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel), chair of the Appropriations Committee who helped navigate the agreement through a conference committee between chambers last week.\n\nThe House voted 101-38 for House Bill 504 on Monday afternoon, and the Senate give the bill final approval a few hours later, on a 34-13 vote.\n\nThe final product struck a balance between the plan put forth by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in January, when the state was in the first throes of its fight to close a $3 billion budget gap for fiscal 2026, and a less-severe package proposed by House.\n\nOne major part of the agreement Monday deals with the implementation of \u201ccollaborative time,\u201d which provides teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan and work with each other on various subjects and also assess student achievement. School systems are supposed to start implementing collaborative time next year.\n\nThe Moore administration had proposed a four-year delay in the start of collaborative time, both for the savings and for practical reasons. State school leaders have said that to fully implement collaborative time, the state would need at least 12,000 teachers at a time when the state faces a teacher shortage.\n\nThe House wanted to keep next year\u2019s implementation date. The House and Senate ultimately agreed to pause the policy requirement for collaborative time for three years, but keep the funding amount at $163 per student for next fiscal year. It would stay at that level until fiscal 2029, when it would jump to $334 per student.\n\nBarnes said Monday evening that keeping the collaborative time funding for next fiscal year but deferring implementation should help local school leaders as they work on budgets for next school year.\n\nLocal school officials have continuously sought more flexibility in the implementation of the Blueprint, now in its third year.\n\nAnother compromise deals with the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, a part of the Blueprint plan that deals with mental health, behavioral and other wraparound services for students.\n\nThe governor proposed $130 million for fiscal 2026, but the House proposed cutting it to $40 million a year. The Senate held out for $70 million next year and $100 million a year thereafter, which was approved in the final bill.\n\nAnother provision dealt with community schools, which are buildings that receive concentration-of-poverty grants based on students who receive free and reduced-price meals.\n\nOne key priority the House was able to secure deals with any funds retained at a school system\u2019s central office, money \u201cmust be used solely to support implementation at the school level.\u201d\n\nPaul Lemle, president of the state Maryland State Education Association, released a statement after the passage of the bill that gave it a mixed review.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a delay to increased funding dedicated for collaborative time implementation, the final bill is a significant improvement over where this conversation began in January,\u201d Lemle said\n\n\u201cWe were able to avoid the near-immediate, outsized cuts to expected funding for students in poverty and multilingual learners, in particular, and we protected the critical expansion of community schools and supports for students in concentrated poverty,\u201d his statement said.",

      "title": "Airstrikes Amid Earthquakes: Myanmar\u2019s Double Disaster",
      "text": "On March 28, Myanmar was devastated by a catastrophic 7.7 magnitude earthquake so severe that significant tremors were felt in Bangkok, Thailand, more than 1,000 kilometers from the quake\u2019s epicenter. This shock comes in the midst of an ongoing civil war, and as parts of the country are still recovering from a cyclone that struck in 2023. This recent disaster has only compounded the vulnerability of local communities.\n\nWhile support systems are nonexistent, the military junta is only further slowing down humanitarian efforts with their aid blockade, restricted communications, and imposed curfews. As of April 3, the death toll had reached 3,085, with at least 4,715 injured and 341 still missing, according to the junta\u2019s likely conservative figures. Thousands more are sleeping on the streets, and lacking basic necessities.\n\nAs if the situation couldn\u2019t get any worse, the Myanmar military has launched a series of airstrikes in various parts of the country, only further traumatizing local communities. From March 28 until the present, DVB News reports that the junta has launched over 40 air and artillery strikes across Myanmar, resulting in at least 12 fatalities. The military has made it clear where its priorities lie \u2013 and they are not with the people. Instead, the generals seem set on capitalizing on the disaster and using it as an opportunity to beat their opponents into submission at a vulnerable time.\n\nFollowing the disaster, the National Unity Government issued an urgent call for a two-week ceasefire on March 29 to facilitate humanitarian response efforts. On April 1, this appeal was reinforced by the Three Brotherhood Alliance of ethnic armed groups, which declared a temporary cessation of hostilities to allow for rescue operations and the delivery of critical aid to earthquake-affected communities. On April 2, nearly a week after the earthquake, the military junta finally announced a ceasefire. However, this declaration is being met with significant skepticism. Many relief organizations and local communities remain wary with the understanding that while airstrikes might temporarily cease in the earthquake ravaged central regions of Sagaing and Mandalay, military operations could continue unabated in other parts of the country.\n\nRather than spend their time and energy on search and rescue teams for trapped civilians, or on delivering much-needed humanitarian aid, the generals have yet again chosen violence. On April 1, junta soldiers fired at a Chinese Red Cross convoy that was escorted by the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army in eastern Shan State en route to Mandalay. With the military doing little to coordinate search and rescue efforts, civilians have instead relied on one another for life saving assistance. Local communities have had to utilize manual tools, including their bare hands, to lift rubble and rescue trapped survivors.\n\nAs the international community rallies to provide aid, organizations must ensure that this support directly reaches affected civilians on the ground. Financial and material assistance sent to the junta is at risk of being utilized by the military for its own gain and/or to further perpetuate violence against civilians. In a statement on March 28, the U.S. Campaign for Burma pointed out that the military has historically proven itself to be incapable of effectively and indiscriminately distributing humanitarian aid during natural disasters.\n\nThe Myanmar military junta\u2019s current prevention of international humanitarian aid for earthquake victims in Sagaing mirrors their deadly playbook from 2008\u2019s Cyclone Nargis, when they blocked critical relief efforts while thousands perished. These two catastrophes highlight how the regime prioritizes maintaining its control over saving civilian lives by deliberately weaponizing natural disasters against its own people. By restricting access during the crucial first 72 hours \u2013 when most lives could have been saved \u2013 and forcing aid through military channels, the junta deliberately delayed rescue operations following both disasters.\n\nThis calculated delay during the \u201cgolden window\u201d for survival served their strategic interests in punishing resistance strongholds, forcing compliance from desperate survivors, and reasserting control over contested regions. The pattern reveals how the regime systematically transforms catastrophes into opportunities for further oppression, using human suffering as a tool while thousands of trapped victims perish needlessly under their corrupt humanitarian response.\n\nEffective channels must be established with local organizations on the ground, which are most aware of the situation and know how to reach affected areas. For years, even before this disaster, these local actors have successfully delivered aid to communities most in need, even in areas considered \u201cinaccessible\u201d by the junta.\n\nForeign governments and international organizations must categorically reject the military junta\u2019s demand that it control aid distribution and establish direct funding mechanisms with local actors, such as community-based organizations and civil society organizations that are directly supporting quake-affected areas. The international community must also enforce sanctions against military regime officials for obstructing emergency aid response. Additionally, world leaders must demand the immediate cessation of airstrikes and military operations, especially in earthquake-affected regions.\n\nThis earthquake has once again exposed the fact that the military junta is not only incapable of governing Myanmar, but is actively working against the survival of its own citizens. Only by bypassing this illegitimate regime and working directly with Myanmar\u2019s resilient civil society can effective humanitarian aid reach those fighting to survive both a natural disaster and a man-made tyranny.",

      "text": "The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the definition of a woman and sex in the Equality Act relates to \"a biological woman and biological sex\".\n\nUK Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge, who announced the decision, made clear that this was not a victory for either side, stressing that the law gives trans people protection against discrimination.\n\n\"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another.\u201d\n\nThe ruling follows a series of challenges brought by the campaign group, For Women Scotland (FWS), over the definition of \"woman\" in Scottish legislation mandating 50% female representation on public boards. But the outcome of the case will have an impact on the whole of the UK after the years-long legal battle ascended to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe case centres on whether or not somebody with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) recognising their gender as female should be treated as a woman under the 2010 Equality Act. FWS has previously said not tying the definition of sex to its \"ordinary meaning\" could have far-reaching consequences for sex-based rights, as well as \"everyday single-sex services\" like toilets and hospital wards.\n\nHowever, lawyers for the Scottish Government told the Supreme Court at a hearing in November that a person with a GRC is \"recognised in law\" as having changed sex. In a ruling on Wednesday, justices at the UK's highest court unanimously ruled in FWS's favour. Lord Hodge, sitting with Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones alongside Ladies Rose and Simler, said the \"central question\" is how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the 2019 Equality Act.\n\nDuring the hearing in November, Aidan O'Neill KC, for FWS, told justices the Scottish ministers' position that sex, man and woman in the Equality Act refer to \"certificated sex\" - as the sex on a person's birth certificate whether or not amended by a gender recognition certificate (GRC) - is \"just wrong and should be rejected by the court\".\n\nBut Ruth Crawford KC, for the Scottish Government, said a person who becomes a woman \"in consequence of a GRC\" is entitled to those protections \"just as much as others enjoy those protections who are recorded as a woman at birth\". She also said the \"inevitable conclusion\" of the FWS challenge, if successful, is that trans women with GRCs would \"remain men until death for the purposes of the Equality Act\".",

      "text": "Harry Potter creator, JK Rowling, has responded to the news that the UK Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is defined as biological sex under the Equality Act of 2010 after airing her previous controversial thoughts on the subject\n\nJK Rowling was quick to respond to the UK Supreme Court's legal definition of a woman today when she jumped on X, formerly Twitter following the verdict. In a major ruling, the court has stated that the definition of a woman and sex in the Equality Act relates to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". However, judge Lord Hodge, who announced the decision, made clear that the law gives trans people protection against discrimination.\n\nTaking to social media, praising the \"tenacious Scottish women\" who 'got this case heard', JK - who has been very vocal about trans people and their rights - said she was \"proud\" of their efforts, claiming they've \"protected the rights of women across the UK\". The Harry Potter star penned: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they\u2019ve protected the rights of women and girls across the UK. @ForWomenScot I\u2019m so proud to know you.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Major UK Supreme Court ruling on legal definition of a woman after 'unanimous decision'\n\nShe later added: \"Trans people have lost zero rights today, although I don\u2019t doubt some (not all) will be furious that the Supreme Court upheld women\u2019s sex-based rights.\"\n\nThe ruling follows a series of challenges brought by the campaign group, For Women Scotland (FWS), over the definition of \"woman\" in Scottish legislation mandating 50% female representation on public boards.\n\nThe outcome of the case will have an impact on the whole of the UK after the lengthy legal battle was heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nResponding to JK's post, many of her fans agreed with her, as one replied: \"All of you who vilified @jk_rowling for standing up for women should hang your heads in shame.\" Meanwhile, another said: \"This is a huge win! Now we need to make the rest of the Western World see reason.\"\n\nHowever, there were others who disagreed with the ruling and JK - who has made a series of controversial tweets regarding the trans community in the past - as they said: \"Trans women are women and there\u2019s no 'argument' about that. Breaks my heart that we\u2019re going backwards and it\u2019s so frustrating feeling so powerless.\"\n\nThe Scottish government had argued that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to sex-based protections, while FWS argued they only apply to people that are born female.\n\nThe case centred on whether or not somebody with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) recognising their gender as female should be treated as a woman under the 2010 Equality Act.\n\nFWS has previously said not aligning the definition of sex to its \"ordinary meaning\" could have far-reaching consequences for sex-based rights, as well as \"everyday single-sex services\" like toilets and hospital wards.\n\nFollowing the court's decision today, the group says it's grateful for the decision after a \"long road\" of legal battles, while charity Scottish Trans urges people \"not to panic\".\n\nThe Scottish government, meanwhile, says it acted \"in good faith\" and will work with Westminster to understand the full implications of the ruling.\n\nLast year, JK admitted her loved ones had \"begged\" for her to keep her views on trans women to herself. The acclaimed author fell from grace with many fans of her Harry Potter saga over recent years as she has taken an outspoken stance against trans women, controversially claiming they were \"not women.\"\n\nThis has earned her worldwide criticism, including from actors Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson who have been vocal about their support of the LGBTQI+ community.\n\nLike this story?

      "title": "Trump Touts Supreme Court Deportation Ruling as a Major Victory, but Legal Fight Is Far From Over",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is touting a Supreme Court ruling allowing it to resume deportations under the Alien Enemies Act as a major victory, but the immigration fight is far from over.\n\nThe divided court found that President Donald Trump can use the 18th century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, a finding Trump called a \u201cGREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\u201d in a social media post.\n\nBut the justices also decided people accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang have to get a chance to challenge their removals \u2014 a finding their lawyers called an \u201cimportant victory.\u201d\n\nThe legal landscape could be more challenging, though, since it appears the people being held will have to file individually and in the district where they are detained. For many, that's in Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court is also weighing another case against a Maryland man deported by mistake that could shed light on the fate of more than 100 men accused of being gang members who have already been sent to prison in El Salvador.\n\nHere's a look at what's next:\n\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t let the deportations under the law resume right away\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling lifted a restraining order from a judge in the nation's capital that had blocked the Trump administration from deporting people under the law.\n\nBut it doesn't allow those deportations to start right away. The court said that the accused have to be given notice and reasonable time to try and convince a judge that they shouldn't be deported.\n\nThe families of multiple people who have already been deported under the Alien Enemies Act say they are not gang members, and should not have been deported under the law.\n\nREAD:\n\nThe 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said on Fox News that she expected future hearings to be held in Texas, and for judges to deal with each case individually rather than issue orders about the group as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt will be a much smoother, simpler hearing,\u201d she said.\n\nTexas may not be the only venue, though. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of two immigrants who are currently held in New York and say they have been wrongly labeled as members of Tren de Aragua, or TdA, putting them at risk of deportation to the prison.\n\nMany questions about Trump\u2019s use of the act remain unresolved\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling did not address the constitutionality of the act or the migrants\u2019 claim that they don\u2019t fall within the category of people who can be deported under the law.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear how this ruling affects the more than 100 people who have already been sent to the El Salvador prison under the Alien Enemies Act without being given an opportunity to challenge their removals before the flights, which the court now says is necessary. The ruling didn't address what kind of recourse, if any, those migrants may be entitled to.\n\nIn another case involving a man mistakenly deported to the El Salvador prison, the administration has said it has no way to get him back. That man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was not deported under the Alien Enemies Act, but the administration has conceded that he shouldn\u2019t have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a deadline for the Trump administration to bring Garcia back to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia's lawyer told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the justices' finding that migrants must have a chance to challenge their removal underscores his client's argument that his rights were violated and that he must be returned to the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndeed because Abrego Garcia was deprived of any judicial review whatsoever, he had no opportunity to even respond to prove that he is not a member of MS-13,\u201d his attorney told the high court in a letter.\n\nTrump administration says it's working to identify alleged gang members\n\nTodd Lyons, acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, said Tuesday that he couldn't estimate how many people would be deported under the act, which the administration wants to use to target foreign terrorists and transnational criminal organizations like Tren de Aragua or TdA.\n\n\u201cThe thing about TdA is there\u2019s no real, like, membership card, they\u2019re not out there self-identifying. It\u2019s really through partnerships with the rest of DHS and local law enforcement identifying those individuals,\u201d Lyons told reporters during Border Security Expo, a trade show in Phoenix.\n\nAsked about the lack of criminal history among some Venezuelans imprisoned in El Salvador and their inability to respond to evidence against them, Lyons said: \u201cI\u2019m confident that those individuals we took action on were the ones we needed to take action on.\u201d\n\nAt the trade show, Deputy Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Modlin received a round of applause as he talked about the videos shared on social media of the shackled migrants sent to the El Salvador prison.\n\n\u201cMan, hats off to the public affairs people in El Salvador. They came up with those videos. That was amazing. It sends a message across the globe,\u201d Modlin said.\n\nThe case has become a flashpoint in Trump\u2019s fight with the courts\n\nEven before the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, the case had become one of the most contentious legal battles waged by the administration over Trump\u2019s sweeping executive actions. Trump has called for the judge\u2019s impeachment, prompting a rare statement from Roberts to say that such action is not the appropriate response to disagreements over court rulings.\n\nBoasberg has been contemplating whether to hold any administration officials in contempt of court for ignoring his orders last month to turn around planes that were carrying the deportees to El Salvador.\n\nBoasberg had been expected to rule as early as this week on whether there are grounds to find anyone in contempt. During a hearing last week, he said the Trump administration may have \u201cacted in bad faith\u201d by trying to rush the migrants out of the country before a court could step in to block the deportations.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Boasberg would move forward with contempt proceedings after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling vacating his order.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer told the judge Monday evening that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201celiminates the basis\u201d for any further action. The Justice Department has said the administration didn\u2019t violate the judge\u2019s order, arguing it didn\u2019t apply to planes that had already left U.S. airspace by the time his command came down.\n\n___",

      "title": "Supreme Court backs Trump in controversial deportations case",
      "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court delivered a major victory to President Trump on Monday, allowing the administration to continue deporting what it says are Venezuelan gang members. The vote was 5-to-4, with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the three liberals in dissent.\n\nAt issue in the case was the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a controversial law invoked only three times in U.S. history, always during wartime, which allows for the detention and deportation of foreign nationals from countries actively invading the United States. The Trump administration argued that the law applied to Venezuelan gang members who were deemed to be invading the nation.\n\nIn an unsigned opinion Monday night, the court's conservative majority didn't rule on that question. But it gave the Trump administration all it needed to continue with the deportations, with one caveat. It said that from here on in, the alleged gang members need to be given notice of deportation, and the opportunity to contest the deportation.\n\nThe court, however, said there is only one way to do that. And that is by challenging their detentions on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe initial lawsuit challenging the order, from the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, had sought to block use of the Alien Enemies Act through a \"class action,\" in which a handful of people can sue on behalf of all other similarly situated individuals.\n\nBut the court said that the men should have brought their challenges through individual \"habeas petitions.\"\n\nTechnically habeas corpus means \"produce the body.\" In practice it means that an imprisoned individual has the right to challenge his detention or deportation, but only for himself, and only, the court said, in the places where deportees were being detained. In this case, the named plaintiffs were being held in Texas, a state, where, as the dissenters observed, judges are not likely to be sympathetic.\n\nThe order marks a win for the Trump administration, even if temporary, and it could well be a harbinger of things to come as the administration continues to clash with federal courts and assert the executive's dominance over the other two branches of government.\n\nIt's unclear what the order means for people who were already deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, after their lawyers said they did not get enough notice of removal. Justice Kavanaugh penned his own concurring opinion.\n\n\"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the Court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory,\" the ACLU's Lee Gelernt said in a texted statement.\n\nJackson warns of emergency docket\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the principal dissent.\n\n\"Critically, even the majority today agrees and the federal government now admits, that individuals subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled\" to judicial notice and review before they can be removed,\" she wrote. And that, she said, \"should have been the end of the matter.\"\n\nInstead, she said the court went further than it had to, granting the government \"extraordinary relief,\" and tossing out the lower court's orders without \"regard for the government's attempts to subvert the judicial process throughout this litigation. Because the court should not reward the government's efforts to erode the rule of law with discretionary equitable relief, I respectfully dissent.\"\n\nAnd Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in dissent as well to stress that the court is embarking on a pattern of deciding \"monumental\" issues, without full briefing, argument, and sufficient time to think through consequences. The court's liberal justices had expressed a similar critique about an emergency order in an Education Department case last week.\n\nJackson noted that the court has on occasion lived to regret decisions that it reached in times of great stress, pointing as an example to the internment of the Japanese in World War II.\n\n\"At least when the court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,\" she wrote. But \"with more and more of our most significant rulings taking place in the shadows or our emergency docket, today's court leaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We are just as wrong now as we have been in the past with similarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are now less willing to face it.\"\n\nAlien Enemies Act proclamation\n\nThe dispute began March 15 when President Trump signed a proclamation ordering the removal of individuals who the administration said were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The State Department designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on Feb. 6.\n\nWithin hours, the administration began filling planes with alleged gang members headed for a prison in El Salvador, where they were detained. Meanwhile, five other alleged gang members, who had not been deported yet, sued in federal court to stop the administration in its tracks.\n\nAlmost immediately, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., temporarily halted the deportations and told the administration to bring back the planes that were already en route to El Salvador.\n\nBut the administration refused to turn the planes around, claiming that it was not legally required to do so, and refusing to answer many of Boasberg's questions, citing national security grounds as the justification. This despite the fact that Boasberg served for seven years on the super-secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, becoming presiding judge in 2020 and 2021. And from 2020 to 2025, he served as chief judge of the United States Alien Terrorist Removal court.\n\nBy granting the stay on Monday, the court also appeared to support Trump's invocation of the controversial Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which had only been used three times in U.S. history before now, and always during a war declared by Congress. The Trump administration claims that while the U.S. is not officially at war with Venezuela, the gang is intertwined with the Venezuelan government, and therefore the gang's presence in the U.S. is an \"invasion\" for purposes of the Act.\n\nOne issue that Boasberg found particularly problematic is that the government held no hearings in which the alleged TdA members could dispute their removal from the country. The judge noted that even when the Alien Enemies Act was used during World War II against Japanese, German, and Italian citizens in the U.S., they were at least given their day in court.\n\nConcerns about due process\n\nIn the days since then, the consequences of not providing due process have continued to play out. An ICE official conceded on March 31 that the agency incorrectly deported a Salvadoran man living in Maryland due to an \"administrative error.\"\n\nNonetheless, Trump and other government officials have called for Boasberg's impeachment, impugning his integrity and contending that he lacked the authority to stop the Trump administration from carrying out its agenda.\n\nThose statements prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare statement rebuking Trump, which read: \"For more than two centuries it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"\n\nFollowing the chief justice's advice, the administration first asked the federal court of appeals in Washington, D.C., to block Boasberg's order and allow the deportations to continue. By a 2-1 vote, the appellate court refused to do that.\n\nAfter losing in the appeals court, the Trump administration immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the president has broad discretionary authority on national security matters, which federal judges should not second-guess. The administration urged the Supreme Court to allow the deportations to resume immediately to ensure the safety of the American people.\n\nThe decision is only the latest in a tsunami of cases challenging Trump's executive orders to date. As of March 28, federal district courts had issued 40 orders blocking the Trump administration's agenda, and Trump has not even reached his first 100 days in office. That is nearly three times as many court orders as were issued during the first three years of the Biden administration.\n\nNPR's Jasmine Garsd contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Celebrity Paycheck Confessions: How Much Money Your Favorite Actors Really Make",
      "text": "Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence was paid $25 million to star in Adam McKay\u2019s ensemble disaster comedy Don\u2019t Look Up. But her costar and fellow Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio got $30 million.\n\n\u201cLook, Leo brings in more box office than I do,\u201d Lawrence told Vanity Fair for its\u2019 December 2020/January 2021 issue. \u201cI\u2019m extremely fortunate and happy with my deal. But in other situations, what I have seen\u2014and I\u2019m sure other women in the workforce have seen as well\u2014is that it\u2019s extremely uncomfortable to inquire about equal pay. And if you do question something that appears unequal, you\u2019re told it\u2019s not gender disparity but they can\u2019t tell you what exactly it is.\u201d\n\nHer sanguine attitude was hard-fought: When the disparity between Lawrence\u2019s compensation and that of her male costars for 2013\u2019s American Hustle was revealed in the 2014 Sony email hack, it prompted an industry-wide conversation about the gender pay gap in Hollywood.\n\n\"I'm so fortunate to have my job. My problem is not money,\" Lawrence told the U.K.\u2019s Channel 4 News in 2017. \"I wasn't upset that I only got this many millions for a movie. That's ridiculous. I was angry about the unfairness and inequality.\"\n\nLess comparable to DiCaprio\u2019s salary: The $60,000 \u201cbefore commissions and taxes\u201d that Jonah Hill was paid for 2013\u2019s The Wolf of Wall Street, while the titular wolf made $10 million.\n\n\u201cThey gave me the lowest amount of money possible,\u201d Hill recalled on The Howard Stern Show in 2014. But it was the chance to appear in a Martin Scorsese movie, so the Moneyball alum wanted to get the deal done before anyone could change their mind.\n\n\u201cI would sell my house and give him all my money to work for [Scorsese],\u201d explained Hill, who earned his second Best Supporting Actor nomination for his turn as a squirrelly substance-abusing stockbroker. \u201cThis isn't what you make money for. You do 22 Jump Street or you do other things, and you can pay your rent. I would have done anything in the world. I would do it again in a second. This isn't about money. You should do things that you care about.\"\n\nWhen she scored the role of late Tejana singer Selena Quintanilla in the 1997 biopic Selena, Jennifer Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn $1 million for a film.\n\n\u201cI was too young and didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on,\u201d Lopez told Variety in 2019, reflecting on her breakout movie. \u201cIt was great they offered me a million dollars. I feel like everyone was making a statement.\u201d\n\nAnd it paved the way for her to make hundreds of millions more, though sometimes her participation doesn\u2019t cost a thing.\n\n\u201cI do things because I love them,\u201d Lopez explained to GQ in 2019. \u201cI didn't get paid a whole bunch of money for Hustlers. I did it for free and produced it. I bank on myself, you know? Like Jenny From the Block\u2014I do what I love.\"\n\n\u201cDo you guys know what they pay us?\u201d Pete Davidson cracked to New York magazine when asked ahead of Saturday Night Live's 50th anniversary special how he spent his money when he was first hired at the age of 20 in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s like three grand an episode, so I think I got dinner.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the salaries have remained proportional for SNL newcomers, with season one stars John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase reportedly earning $750 an episode back in 1975. Which was roughly equivalent to $3,300 in 2014, according to the Consumer Price Index Inflation calculator. (Though the $750 of 1975 is $4,428 in 2025.)\n\nFeeling not so appreciated, Tommy Dorfman got specific about her 13 Reasons Why paycheck during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike\u2014which was prompted in part (as was the WGA strike) by streamers like Netflix not making it a practice to pay additional compensation to cast and crew once a show had become a big hit.\n\n\"my earnings for the entire first season of 13 reasons why were $29,953.24 prior to agency and manager fees (20%) and taxes,\" Dorfman wrote on Threads July 24. \"8 episodes over six months.\" She continued, \u201ci did all of the promo and had KEY ART for this show, flew round trip from NYC to SF to shoot for every episode, was kept for days without pay/working. i barely qualified for insurance.\"\n\nAnd, Dorfman added, \u201cwithin the first 28 days of release, the show's season 1 garnered a total of 476 million view hours. this is why we strike.\"\n\nWithout naming names or numbers, Dax Shepard told fellow Parenthood alum Lauren Graham when she appeared on his podcast that he knew he made \u201camong the lowest of all the actors\u201d on their NBC drama, which ran for six seasons.\n\nBut, the Armchair Expert host stressed that he did not mind.\n\n\u201cEvery job I had ever had in my life prior to Parenthood, I made a point to find out what everyone was making,\u201d he said. \u201cI'd always figure it out\u2014either a conversation where I get it out of them or I backchannel through an agent.\"\n\nSo he made a point to purposely not seek out such info about his Parenthood family, which helped with enjoying the experience even when he did get an inkling of where he was on the pay pyramid.\n\n\u201cI got a dollar for writing the script,\u201d George Clooney told the Los Angeles Times in 2005 about the financial strings he pulled to get his film Good Night, and Good Luck made. \u201cI had to endorse my check for directing and turn in my acting salary. [Actor, cowriter and coproducer Grant Heslov] and I each made a buck for doing it.\u201d\n\nHis labor of love about CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow speaking truth to power in the 1950s had legs, though: Making his Broadway debut, Clooney is playing Murrow in a stage adaptation of the film. And with the play having grossed a Broadway record (for a nonmusical) $3.3 million during a preview week before it officially opened April 3, he\u2019s making a lot more than $1.\n\nRebel Wilson detailed in her 2024 memoir Rebel Rising that she was paid $3,500 to do Bridesmaids, \u201ca fee that I then had to pay directly to the Screen Actors Guild to join the union. So really, I got paid nothing.\u201d\n\nStill, she wrote, the experience was \u201ceverything!\u201d\n\nAnd the Australian actress\u2019 star rose ever a-ca higher, with her fee going from the SAG minimum scale of $65,000 for 2012\u2019s Pitch Perfect to $10 million for 2017\u2019s Pitch Perfect 3. Wilson wrote that she raked in $20 million total for the threequel, Isn\u2019t It Romantic and The Hustle, though\u2014reality alert\u2014she \u201clost almost 50 percent to taxes, 10 percent to agents and 5 percent\u201d to her lawyer. But even after those obligations and paying her publicist, business manager and assistant, Wilson \u201cnetted what to me was an absolute fortune.\u201d\n\nIn late 2017, Ellen Pompeo negotiated a new Grey\u2019s Anatomy contract for $575,000 per episode, a seven-figure signing bonus and two full backend equity points worth an estimated $6 million to $7 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 48 now, so I\u2019ve finally gotten to the place where I\u2019m OK asking for what I deserve, which is something that comes only with age,\u201d Pompeo told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not the most \u2018relevant\u2019 actress out there. I know that\u2019s the industry perception because I\u2019ve been this character for 14 years. But the truth is, anybody can be good on a show season one and two. Can you be good 14 years later? Now, that\u2019s a f--kin\u2019 skill.\u201d\n\nReflecting more recently on how she always made less than costar Patrick Dempsey, even though she was the Grey in question, Pompeo said she didn\u2019t begrudge him his money.\n\nBut, she said on a March 2025 episode of Call Her Daddy, \u201cJust being that I was the namesake of the show, I deserved the same and that was harder to get. I wasn't salty about him getting what he got. I was salty that they didn't value me as much as they valued him and they never will.\u201d\n\nJamie Lee Curtis recalled getting paid $2,000 a week\u2014so $8,000 in total\u2014for 1978\u2019s Halloween, her movie debut. \u201cI mean,\u201d she told Rotten Tomatoes in 2018, \u201cnobody got paid, anything.\u201d\n\nYet while the scream queen earned four figures, director John Carpenter\u2019s friend Nick Castle felt like a king making $25 per day to share the role of Michael Myers. (It\u2019s Anthony Moran whose face you see when the killer\u2019s mask comes off for a freaky second, and editor Tommy Lee Wallace also logged screentime as Michael.)\n\n\u201cThat was a lot at the time!\u201d Castle, who attended film school at USC with Carpenter, told Vanity Fair in 2018. \u201cYou have to remember: My interest in doing the film was being on set, so I could demystify the experience of filmmaking and directing. I expected to hang around the set for no money. But hey, $25 per day, and all I had to do was wear a rubber mask.\u201d\n\nTaraji P. Henson earned a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for 2008\u2019s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but years later she was still fired up by the $150,000 she accepted to be in the movie\u2014after producers rejected the $500,000 quote she brought to the table.\n\nAs for the film\u2019s leads Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, \u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot of $20 million quotes anymore, but at this time that was happening,\u201d Henson said on the Ladies First With Laura Brown podcast in 2021. \u201cAnd rightfully so\u2014I\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t have paid Cate and Brad what they deserved.\u201d\n\nBut, she continued, \u201cI\u2019m bringing a certain amount to the seat too and I felt like what I was asking at that time in my career was fair, was fair to the ticket sales that I would contribute to this big film. Wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Henson was \u201cgutted\u201d when they offered $100,000, she recalled. \u201cWhen it was all said and done I got $150,000, but I had to swallow my pride, baby.\u201d\n\nBreaking it down, \u201cI know people go, \u2018$150,000, that\u2019s a lot of money!\u2019\u201d Henson acknowledged. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want people to think that I\u2019m ungrateful because that is not me.\u201d But, she calculated, \u201cUncle Sam is going to take 50 percent of that, so now you\u2019re left with, what? $75,000. Now before Uncle Sam takes the money, I have to pay my team before taxes, 30 percent. So once Uncle Sam takes his 75, then I got another 30 that\u2019s coming off of that 75, so I may have made $40,000?\u201d\n\nWhile Blanchett has made plenty of money over the years, it didn\u2019t all come from playing royal elf Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings franchise, though it grossed $2.9 billion at the worldwide box office.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me? No,\u201d she retorted on Watch What Happens Live in August 2024 when Andy Cohen guessed LOTR was her biggest paycheck. \u201cNo one got paid anything to do that movie\u2026I mean, I basically got free sandwiches, and I got to keep my ears.\u201d",

      "title": "Kerry Washington boldly rejects presidential affair rumors",
      "text": "Actress addresses rumors during talk show appearance\n\nSetting the record straight\n\nAcclaimed television star Kerry Washington has firmly rejected widespread speculation about an alleged romantic relationship with a former commander-in-chief during a candid television interview. The \u201cScandal\u201d actress addressed the unfounded rumors with characteristic poise and humor while appearing on a late-night talk program in late 2012.\n\nWashington, who portrays crisis management expert Olivia Pope in the popular political drama series, used the high-profile platform to definitively counter the persistent gossip that had been circulating in entertainment circles. With remarkable composure, she dismissed the allegations while maintaining her trademark grace under pressure.\n\nThe celebrity rumor mill\n\nMedia speculation and its consequences\n\nThe entertainment landscape frequently generates unsubstantiated claims about public figures, particularly when politics and Hollywood intersect. This phenomenon disproportionately affects women in the public eye, who often face heightened scrutiny regarding their personal relationships and choices.\n\nThe Washington situation exemplifies how quickly baseless conjecture can proliferate across traditional and social media channels, potentially damaging reputations and creating unnecessary complications for all parties involved. The actress\u2019s decision to address these rumors directly reflects a growing trend among celebrities who choose to confront misinformation rather than allowing it to fester unchallenged.\n\nIndustry observers note that public figures increasingly find themselves navigating a complex information ecosystem where fact and fiction blur easily. The pressure to maintain privacy while simultaneously managing public perception creates a delicate balancing act for those in the spotlight.\n\nProfessional implications\n\nNavigating career challenges\n\nThroughout her distinguished career, Washington has established herself as a formidable presence in an industry known for its limited opportunities for women of color. Her groundbreaking role as Olivia Pope represents a significant milestone in television history, presenting a multidimensional African American female protagonist in a primetime drama.\n\nWashington\u2018s handling of personal rumors demonstrates the additional obstacles faced by prominent minority figures in entertainment. Beyond the typical challenges of securing meaningful roles and receiving fair compensation, these professionals must often contend with heightened public interest in their personal affairs and relationships.\n\nThe actress has consistently emphasized her commitment to her craft while maintaining appropriate boundaries around her private life. This deliberate separation between professional and personal spheres has become increasingly difficult in an era of constant connectivity and social media scrutiny.\n\nMedia responsibility\n\nThe ethics of reporting\n\nThe persistence of unfounded rumors raises important questions about journalistic standards and media ethics. Entertainment news outlets must balance public interest against the potential harm caused by amplifying unverified claims. When such speculation involves high-ranking government officials, the implications extend beyond mere celebrity gossip into potentially damaging territory for democratic institutions.\n\nMedia literacy experts emphasize the importance of critical consumption practices among audiences. The ability to distinguish between credible reporting and speculative content becomes increasingly vital as information sources multiply and traditional gatekeepers lose influence. Washington\u2019s experience highlights the real-world consequences when these distinctions collapse.\n\nCommunication scholars suggest that celebrities like Washington face unique challenges in an information environment optimized for engagement rather than accuracy. Provocative claims generate more interaction than careful, nuanced reporting, creating perverse incentives throughout the media ecosystem.\n\nIndustry representation\n\nBreaking barriers in entertainment\n\nWashington\u2019s career trajectory represents a significant evolution in Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of African American women. Prior to her breakthrough role, leading positions for women of color remained disappointingly scarce across television networks. Her success helped demonstrate the commercial viability of diverse storytelling, paving the way for subsequent productions featuring multidimensional minority characters.\n\nThe actress has leveraged her platform to advocate for greater inclusion throughout the entertainment industry. By producing content, directing projects, and supporting emerging talents, Washington has worked to create opportunities for underrepresented voices both onscreen and behind the camera. Her commitment to authenticity extends beyond her performances to include meaningful contributions to the broader media landscape.\n\nIndustry analysts credit Washington with helping to transform audience expectations regarding representation in popular entertainment. By consistently delivering compelling performances in complex roles, she has challenged prevailing assumptions about viewer preferences and marketability.\n\nCultural significance\n\nImpact beyond entertainment\n\nThe intersection of politics and celebrity culture reveals much about contemporary American society. When rumors connecting high-profile figures from different spheres gain traction, they reflect underlying tensions and fascinations within the broader culture. The persistent interest in Washington\u2019s personal associations demonstrates the complicated relationship between entertainment, politics, and public discourse.\n\nCultural critics observe that gossip involving powerful figures serves multiple functions beyond mere entertainment value. Such narratives often provide accessible entry points for discussing complex power dynamics, institutional structures, and social hierarchies. Washington\u2019s experience illustrates how individual celebrities frequently become unwitting symbols within these larger conversations.\n\nMoving forward\n\nProfessional evolution\n\nIn the years following her decisive response to the unfounded rumors, Washington has continued to develop her impressive creative portfolio. Beyond acting, she has expanded into production, directing, and advocacy work, demonstrating remarkable versatility and business acumen. Her trajectory exemplifies how talented performers can transcend limiting narratives to build multifaceted careers on their own terms.\n\nThe actress maintains significant influence within the entertainment industry while carefully managing her public persona. By controlling which aspects of her life receive public attention, Washington has established a sustainable approach to fame that preserves essential boundaries. Her strategic navigation of celebrity culture provides a valuable model for emerging talents facing similar challenges.\n\nAs Washington continues to select projects that challenge conventions and expand representation, her legacy extends far beyond any momentary controversies or unfounded speculations. Her contributions to television and film have permanently altered the landscape for performers from historically marginalized backgrounds, creating lasting impact throughout the industry.\n\nThrough her dignified handling of baseless rumors and consistent professional excellence, Washington has demonstrated the power of maintaining one\u2019s integrity amid the unpredictable currents of public attention. Her example reminds audiences and fellow industry professionals alike that substance ultimately prevails over sensation.",

      "text": "In a lavish party they called the \u201cOscars of Science,\u201d the billionaires behind the Breakthrough Prizes handed out $3-million awards in April to the researchers in life sciences, physics and math they\u2019ve deemed \u201cheroes of our society.\u201d\n\nThe 1 percenters behind the prizes include Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg, who attended and helped fund Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, as well as Yuri Milner and former 23 and Me CEO Anne Wojcicki, who also have ties to the Trump family.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, of course, that Zuckerberg and Brin rolled out the red carpet for science while the autocrat they helped take office ruthlessly carpet-bombs the U.S. scientific enterprise. It\u2019s hard to feel any sympathy for these modern-day Rockefellers, who cast their lot with a man whose mind-boggling trade war has suddenly punched holes in their net worths.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nSo here\u2019s a suggestion for the redemption tour, fellas: Fund more basic research. Back more science. Put your money into the beginning of the next Breakthrough Prizes instead of at the end. And while you\u2019re at it, make sure that work you fund is open source, peer-reviewed, well-designed and ethical, not subject to anti-DEI lunacy, undue influence or conflict of interest. Do your best to help re-create the scientific juggernaut that helped enrich you and understand that it will still not be enough.\n\nThis about-face would not save face, but it could help save science. The damage you\u2019ve enabled is simply unfathomable.\n\nSince the president\u2019s first days in office, science has been under the guillotine at every turn. From freezing federal funding that goes to universities to firing in-house scientists at multiple federal agencies, Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s plan to reduce the size of the federal government and cancel all research that doesn\u2019t fit into their right wing ideology of cisgendered, heterosexual whiteness has threatened the immediate livelihoods of hundreds of scientists, not to mention the American public. Clinical trials have abruptly stopped, public lands have been opened to private extraction, and the average American has woken up each day with fewer evidence-based safeguards and less accountability for what remains.\n\nThat the Breakthrough billionaires can throw a Hollywood party and laud the kind of science that has given us powerful weight-loss drugs and insight into the inner workings of the atom is simply insulting, as they not only watch Rome burn in the process but have used their cash to kindle the fire.\n\nScience and innovation in the U.S. are a trillion-dollar endeavor. For every public dollar we spend on research, we get more than twice that back in economic returns. Publicly funded science gave us nearly every single thing these people celebrated last week. Joel Habener, one of the scientists awarded with the Breakthrough Prize for the discovery of GLP-1, the basis of the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has had funding from the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for decades. Stephen Hauser, one of the scientists awarded for work in developing rituximab, a biologic drug for multiple sclerosis, has multiple grants from Health and Human Services agencies. David Liu, gene editing savant? Federal dollars fund his research, too.\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider at CERN is an international scientific venture. Guess who funds 20 percent of some of the prizewinning research there? The National Science Foundation. And Rebecca Jensen-Clem, one of the astronomers who won a physics prize, is funded in part, by NASA.\n\nWhether or not these particular scientists or these particular projects get caught up in the administration\u2019s ideology sweep is irrelevant. Trump showed us, over and over during his first administration, how little he cared about science and how little he cared about evidence, unless he could take credit for it. Gutting federal research, pausing academic research, all of it slows the R & D engine that has made this country such a superpower, such an ambassador of goodwill around the world. What DOGE and the Trump administration are doing isn\u2019t just awful. It\u2019s incredibly bad policy, both foreign and domestic, and our best minds will leave. Science is an undeniable tool for diplomacy. But not if scientists can\u2019t trust their government.\n\nMeanwhile the Carnegies of a new era celebrated Trump\u2019s ascendence for what it might do for them\u2014remove regulations and ease the ability to use artificial intelligence for anything and everything.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked. Trump took the money. He hasn\u2019t delivered. And no one could\u2019ve imagined this was coming, right?\n\nSo, now, tech billionaires, comes the reckoning. Now comes the realization that the team to which you hitched your wagon has its own agenda, one that easily sacrifices you. Understand that people may not forgive you \u2013 some of you once campaigned against Trump, but now you want his favor. But make amends. Shore up American science. Put your money where your red carpet is until evidence-based thought leads our country once again. If you want the innovation that will make your businesses thrive, pay for it.\n\nFix the wrong you helped realize. Fund the science that Trump and his administration want to erase.",

      "title": "2025 Breakthrough Prize Ceremony Puts Science in the Spotlight",
      "text": "This year\u2019s Breakthrough Prize\u2014popularly known as the \u201cOscars of Science\u201d\u2014brought the world\u2019s leading scientists together with Hollywood\u2019s top stars to celebrate their incredible achievements and inspire the next generation of scientists in a night that coalesced science, pop culture, and tech.\n\nFounded in 2012, the Breakthrough Prize was created by tech giants Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, Julia & Yuri Milner, and Anne Wojcicki to celebrate the wonders of our advanced scientific age. To date, the Breakthrough Prize remains the world\u2019s largest science award\u2014the prize awards six prizes of $3 million, roughly three times the amount of the Nobel Prize purse size\u2014and strives to elevate the stature of research in pop culture with a celebrity guest list not dissimilar from the Academy Awards.\n\nWith its awards, the Breakthrough Prize recognizes achievements in the Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics, and Mathematics. It also granted eight early-career physicists and mathematicians six $100,000 New Horizons Prizes and three women mathematicians a $50,000 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize. This year alone, the organization awarded $18.75 million in prize funds\u2014bringing the total amount granted over the last 14 years of the Breakthrough Prize to more than $326 million.\n\nHosted by actor and comedian James Corden, this year\u2019s ceremony featured celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Alicia Keys, Leonardo DiCaprio, Drew Barrymore, and Mr. Beast\u2014as well as tech entrepreneurs like Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The 2025 awards specifically honored individuals pioneering discoveries in gene editing, human diseases, and the fundamental particles of the universe and its underlying mathematical principles.\n\nIn the Life Sciences, Daniel J. Drucker, Joel Habener, Jens Juul Holst, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen and Svetlana Mojsov share a prize for discoveries that have led to highly effective drugs for diabetes and obesity\u2014welcoming a new era of GLP-1 medicines for cardiometabolic disorders that\u2019s transforming the treatment of metabolic diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide.\n\nStephen L. Hauser and Alberto Ascherio have transformed the understanding and treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), a debilitating neurodegenerative disease in which the immune system attacks the insulating protein around nerve fibers. Hauser overturned previous understanding around the disease\u2019s mechanism and revolutionized modern treatment of MS with B-cell depleting therapies while Ascherio identified that infection by the Epstein-Barr virus is the leading risk for multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe last Life Science laureate, David R Liu developed two powerful, widely used gene-editing technologies which are able to correct mutations in our DNA (without cutting the DNA double helix) that cause genetic diseases in patients. His technologies have already been distributed in labs globally, resulting in thousands of advances in research, biomedicine, and agriculture, and have already shown life-saving results in treatment of T-cell leukemia, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and high cholesterol.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Breakthrough Prize laureates have made amazing strides \u2014 including treatments for major diseases affecting millions of people worldwide \u2014 showing once again the transformative power of curiosity-driven basic science,\u201d said Chan and Zuckerberg, Prize Co-Founder and Co-CEOs of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThis year\u2019s Fundamental Physics award was shared by thousands of researchers across 70 countries representing four experimental collaborations at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider: The ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb. Recognized for testing the modern theory of particle physics, the four experiments set strong bounds on possibilities for new physics regarding dark matter, supersymmetry and hidden extra dimensions; precisely measuring properties of the Higgs boson and elucidating the mechanism by which the Higgs field gives mass to elementary particles; and exploring differences between matter and antimatter to push the boundaries of fundamental physics unlike ever before. In addition, the Special Breakthrough Prize was awarded to Gerard \u2018t Hooft, one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent theoretical physicists.\n\nDennis Gaitsgory was this year\u2019s sole Mathematics Breakthrough Prize winner for his role in the proof of the Langlands Program, a powerful series of conjectures proposing precise connections between seemingly disparate mathematical concepts. Considered generalizations of the Fourier transform, a tool that relates waves to frequency, the geometric Langlands conjecture proposes correspondence between two very different sets of objects \u2014 a monumental advancement in the field that Gaitsgory has spent much of the last 30 years working towards.",

      "title": "Cuts to science research funding cut American lives short \u2212 federal support is essential for medical breakthroughs",
      "text": "Nearly every modern medical treatment can be traced to research funded by the National Institutes of Health: from over-the-counter and prescription medications that treat high cholesterol and pain to protection from infectious diseases such as polio and smallpox.\n\nThe remarkable successes of the decades-old partnership between biomedical research institutions and the federal government are so intertwined with daily life that it\u2019s easy to take them for granted.\n\nHowever, the scientific work driving these medical advances and breakthroughs is in jeopardy. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are terminating hundreds of active research grants under the current administration\u2019s direction. The administration has also proposed a dramatic reduction in federal support of the critical infrastructure that keeps labs open and running. Numerous scientists and health professionals have noted that changes will have far-reaching, harmful outcomes for the health and well-being of the American people.\n\nThe negative consequences of defunding U.S. biomedical research can be difficult to recognize. Most breakthroughs, from the basic science discoveries that reveal the causes of diseases to the development of effective treatments and cures, can take years. Real-time progress can be hard to measure.\n\nAs biomedical researchers studying infectious diseases, viruses and immunology, we and our colleagues see this firsthand in our own work. Thousands of ongoing national and international projects dedicated to uncovering the causes of life-threatening diseases and developing new treatments to improve and save lives are supported by federal agencies such as the NIH and NSF.\n\nConsidering a few of the breakthroughs made possible through U.S. federal support can help illustrate not only the significant inroads biomedical research has made for preventing, treating and curing human maladies, but what all Americans stand to lose if the U.S. reduces its investment in these endeavors.\n\nA cure for cancer\n\nThe hope and dream of curing cancer unites many scientists, health professionals and affected families across the U.S. After decades of ongoing NIH-supported research, scientists have made significant progress in realizing this goal.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute of the NIH is the world\u2019s largest funder of cancer research. This investment has led to advances in cancer treatment and prevention that helped reduce the overall U.S. cancer death rate by 33% from 1991 to 2021.\n\nBasic science research on what causes cancer has led to new strategies to harness a patient\u2019s own immune system to eliminate tumors. For example, all 12 patients in a 2022 clinical trial testing one type of immunotherapy had their rectal cancer completely disappear, without remission or adverse effects.\n\nAnother example of progress is the 2024 results of an ongoing clinical trial of a targeted therapy for lung cancer, showing an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Similarly, in a study of women who were immunized against the human papillomavirus at age 12 or 13, none developed the disease later. Since the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer deaths have dropped 62%.\n\nDespite these incredible successes, there is still a long way to go. In 2024, over 2 million people in the U.S. were estimated to be newly diagnosed with cancer, and 611,720 were expected to die from the disease.\n\nWithout sustained federal support for cancer research, progress toward curing cancer and reducing its death rate will stall.\n\nAutoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases\n\nNearly every family is touched in some way by autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Government-funded research has enabled major advances to combat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nFor example, approximately 1 in 5 Americans have arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes joint swelling and stiffness. A leading cause of disability and economic costs in the U.S., there is no cure for arthritis. But new drugs in development are able to significantly improve symptoms and slow or prevent disease progression.\n\nResearchers are also gaining insight into what causes multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerves and can result in paralysis. Scientists recently found a link between multiple sclerosis and Epstein-Barr virus, a pathogen estimated to infect over 90% of adults around the world. While multiple sclerosis is currently incurable, identifying its underlying cause can provide new avenues for prevention and treatment.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease causes irreversible nerve damage and is the leading cause of dementia. In 2024, 6.9 million Americans ages 65 and older were living with Alzheimer\u2019s. Most treatments address cognitive and behavioral symptoms. However, two new drugs developed with NIH-supported research and clinical trials were approved in July 2023 and July 2024 to treat early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s. Federal funding is also supporting the development of blood tests for earlier detection of the disease.\n\nNone of these breakthroughs are a cure. But they represent important steps forward on the path toward ultimately reducing or eliminating these devastating ailments. Lack of funding will slow or block further progress, leading to the continued rise of the incidence and severity of these conditions.\n\nInfectious diseases and the next pandemic\n\nThe world\u2019s capacity to combat infectious disease will also be weakened by cuts to U.S. federal support of biomedical research.\n\nOver the past 50 years, medical and public health advances have led to the eradication of smallpox globally and the elimination of polio in the U.S. HIV/AIDS, once a death sentence, is now a disease that can be managed with medication. Moreover, a new version of treatments called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, offers complete protection against HIV transmission when taken only twice per year.\n\nSimilarly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical role biomedical research plays in responding to public health threats. Increased federal support of science during this time allowed the United States to emerge with new drugs, vaccine platforms with the potential to treat a variety of chronic diseases, and insights on how to effectively detect and respond to pandemic threats.\n\nThe ongoing avian influenza outbreak and its spillover into American dairy herds and poultry farms is another pandemic threat looming on the horizon. Rather than build upon infrastructure for outbreak surveillance and preparedness, grants that would allow scientists to better understand long COVID-19, vaccines and other pandemic-related research are being cut. Decreased funding of biomedical research will hamper the U.S.\u2019s ability to respond to the next pandemic, putting everyone at risk.\n\nLosses from defunding biomedical research\n\nThe National Institutes of Health contributed over $100 billion to support research that ultimately led to the development of all new drugs approved from 2010 to 2016 alone. Over 90% of this funding was for basic research into understanding the causes of disease that provides the foundation for new treatments.\n\nUnder the new directive to eliminate projects that support or use terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion, the NIH and other federal agencies have made deep cuts to biomedical research that will directly affect patient lives.\n\nAlready, nearly 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and nearly 11% with Alzheimer\u2019s. About 1 in 5 Americans will die from heart disease, and nearly 1.4 million will be rushed to an emergency room due to pneumonia from an infectious disease.\n\nDefunding biomedical research will result in a cascade of effects. There will likely be fewer clinical trials, fewer new treatments and fewer lifesaving drugs. Labs will likely shut down, jobs will be lost, and the process of discovery will stall. The U.S.\u2019s health care system, economy and standing as the world\u2019s leader in scientific innovation will likely decline.\n\nMoreover, when the pipelines of scientific progress are turned off, they will not so easily be turned back on. These consequences will affect all Americans and the rest of the world for decades.\n\nUniversity shortfalls directly resulting from cuts to research support will dramatically reduce the capacity of American institutions to educate and provide opportunities for the next generation. Funding cuts have led to the shuttering or heavy reduction of training programs for future scientists.\n\nGraduate students and postdoctoral trainees are the lifeblood of biomedical research. Supporting these young people committed to public service through research and health care is also an investment in medical advancements and public health. But the uncertainty and instability resulting from the divestment of federally funded programs will likely severely deplete the biomedical workforce, crippling the United States\u2019 ability to deliver future biomedical breakthroughs.\n\nBy cutting biomedical research funding, Americans and the rest of the world stand to lose new cures, new treatments and an entire generation of researchers.",

      "title": "The Rise of AI in Scientific Discoveries: Can AI Truly Think Outside the Box?",
      "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, with its applications spreading across industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. Among the most exciting areas for AI is scientific research. AI's ability to process vast data, recognize complex patterns, and make predictions is accelerating the pace at which scientific discoveries are made. This raises an intriguing question: Can AI think outside the box and generate truly novel ideas like human scientists? To explore this, we must examine how AI is currently being used in scientific discovery and whether it can genuinely produce original thoughts.\n\nAI's Growing Role in Scientific Discoveries\n\nAI has made significant strides in various scientific fields, including drug discovery, genomics, materials science, climate research, and astronomy. By processing massive datasets that humans can't handle, AI has been instrumental in identifying potential drug candidates, modeling climate change, and even proposing new theories about the universe.\n\nFor example, researchers at MIT used AI to discover a new antibiotic in days, targeting bacteria resistant to existing drugs. In biology, DeepMind's AlphaFold solved the protein folding problem, predicting 3D protein structures vital for drug development. In materials science, AI models like GNoME predicted millions of new crystals that could redefine technologies such as batteries and solar cells. AI has also aided in physics by suggesting new ways to model physical phenomena and in astronomy by discovering exoplanets and gravitational lenses. In climate science, AI has enhanced climate predictions and helped model extreme weather events.\n\nCan AI Think Outside the Box?\n\nWhile AI\u2019s contributions to scientific discoveries are undeniable, the question remains: Can it truly think outside the box? Human scientific progress has often relied on intuition, creativity, and the courage to challenge existing paradigms. These breakthroughs typically come from scientists willing to think beyond conventional wisdom.\n\nAI, however, is driven by data. It analyzes patterns and predicts outcomes based on the information provided, but it doesn\u2019t possess the imaginative, abstract thinking that humans do. In this sense, AI\u2019s creativity is different from human creativity. AI operates within the constraints of its data and algorithms, which limits its ability to perform truly creative, out-of-the-box thinking.\n\nThat said, the situation is more complex. AI has shown that it can generate new hypotheses, suggest innovative solutions, and even challenge established knowledge in some areas. For instance, machine learning models have been used to create novel chemical compounds and design materials that humans had not previously considered. In some cases, these discoveries have led to breakthroughs that would have been difficult for human researchers to achieve on their own.\n\nArguments Supporting AI\u2019s Creativity\n\nProponents argue that AI demonstrates creativity by generating ideas that are not immediately obvious to human researchers. For instance, AlphaFold used a novel deep learning architecture to solve the protein folding challenge, which had eluded scientists for decades. Similarly, Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0-powered AI has been used to create original hypotheses and research proposals, allowing scientists to bridge gaps between different scientific domains. A study from the University of Chicago suggests that AI could generate \u201calien\u201d hypotheses \u2013 innovative ideas that humans may not think of, expanding the boundaries of scientific exploration. These examples suggest that AI has the potential to think outside the box by proposing novel ideas.\n\nArguments Against AI\u2019s Creativity\n\nCritics argue that AI is fundamentally limited because it relies on existing knowledge and datasets. Its work is more like filling in gaps in data rather than questioning existing assumptions. AI\u2019s creativity, according to critics, is constrained by the data it is trained on, preventing it from making truly groundbreaking discoveries.\n\nThomas Wolf, a notable AI expert, asserts that true innovation \u2013 like Einstein\u2019s ideas \u2013 requires asking entirely new questions and challenging conventional wisdom. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems, despite their extensive training, do not demonstrate the ability to generate truly novel insights. Thus, AI is seen more as an efficient tool for learning rather than a genuine thinker capable of breaking through established scientific paradigms.\n\nAdditionally, AI lacks the human qualities of intuition, emotion, and serendipity that often drive creative breakthroughs. AI works within predefined algorithms, relying on logical and systematic processes. According to Entrepreneur, this algorithmic approach is very different from the unpredictable, spontaneous nature of human creativity. A research paper from ScienceDirect also argues that AI-generated creativity may look innovative but doesn\u2019t provide the same depth of insight that human creativity does.\n\nSynthesis and Implications\n\nWhile AI can certainly think outside the box in some ways \u2013 especially when it comes to identifying patterns and proposing new solutions \u2013 it differs from human creativity in that it relies on data-driven analysis rather than intuition or life experience. AI\u2019s role in scientific discovery is better understood as a partner to human scientists, rather than a replacement.\n\nResearch from Imperial College Business School shows that AI complements traditional scientific methods, helping to uncover new principles and address declining research productivity. Similarly, Kellogg researchers have found that AI can have a positive impact across scientific fields but emphasize that training and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to fully utilize AI's potential.\n\nThe most significant advancements in science are likely to come from combining human creativity with AI\u2019s analytical abilities. Together, they can accelerate breakthroughs and lead to discoveries beyond what we can currently imagine.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAI is transforming scientific research by accelerating discoveries and introducing new ways of thinking. While AI has demonstrated the ability to generate hypotheses and identify novel patterns, it is not quite capable of thinking outside the box in the same way humans can. As of 2025, ongoing developments suggest that its influence on science will continue to grow. However, it is crucial to ensure that AI supports human efforts rather than replaces them, with careful attention to transparency, validation, and ethical integration. By working alongside human creativity, AI can enhance scientific progress and open new avenues for exploration.",

      "title": "Opinion: Vital medical breakthroughs still need animal research",
      "text": "This is one of two op-eds published today on the question of whether to close OHSU\u2019s National Primate Research Center. To read the op-ed by the head of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, click here.\n\nPeter Barr-Gillespie and Skip Bohm\n\nFor The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nBarr-Gillespie, Ph.D., is executive vice president and chief research officer at OHSU. Bohm, D.V.M., is a diplomate for the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine and director of OHSU\u2019s Oregon National Primate Research Center in Beaverton.\n\nMedical breakthroughs have transformed billions of lives. In our lifetimes, we\u2019ve seen how new medicines have turned HIV from a death sentence into a treatable condition. We\u2019ve witnessed the creation of gene and stem cell therapies that hold the possibility of treating alcoholism, diabetes and blindness. We\u2019ve marveled over the whirlwind development of the COVID-19 vaccine that tamed a once-in-a-century pandemic.\n\nResearchers at Oregon Health & Science University have had a hand in some of those advances and are continuing to drive innovation in others, from developing a universal flu vaccine to helping childhood cancer survivors regain their ability to have children.\n\nThese headline-grabbing successes, however, don\u2019t come quickly or easily. They are the result of painstaking research that explores everything from how an individual molecule connects to a protein to the systemic effects of stimulating certain areas of the brain. Ideas are tested and experiments are recalibrated. Failures are vital information; successes are one step closer to a new therapy.\n\nAnd before any potential treatment or new therapy is given to a patient, it must first be tested in animals to help understand how it may act in people and discover any potential side effects. This step is required by the scientific and regulatory communities for safety and ethical reasons. Indeed, a dark history of deeply unethical human testing has led to this requirement.\n\nWe understand this research is controversial and makes many people uncomfortable; we ourselves are animal lovers as well as scientists. Still, we stand firm that this research is critically important if we are to identify, prevent, treat or eradicate debilitating diseases and improve human health.\n\nAlthough nonhuman primates represent fewer than 1% of all research animals, this research is increasingly significant as the human population ages and rates of chronic diseases grow. It is also critical for emergent public health issues, playing an essential role in vaccine development.\n\nAt OHSU, we understand the profound responsibility that comes with using nonhuman primates. Animal studies are only conducted when other research methods \u2014 such as laboratory-based cell culture or computer modeling \u2014 cannot reliably replicate a complex system. State and federal regulators and OHSU\u2019s strict policies require transparency and oversight to demonstrate that proposed research using animals benefits science and human health. Care of research animals is heavily regulated, and we welcome that accountability.\n\nWith all of this, it may come as a surprise that our ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for animals in research. But we are not there yet.\n\nScientists using nonhuman primates have long strived to replace them with alternative technologies. We established a program funding innovative \u201cnew approach methodology\u201d to reduce the number of animals used and improve animal welfare. Currently, these methods cannot fully substitute for complex living organisms, and, for ethical and safety reasons, require validation to be sure they accurately predict outcomes. Nevertheless, we are pursuing technologies that will someday eliminate the need for animals in research.\n\nAdvocates for closing the research center claim that nonhuman primates are systematically mistreated here. Nothing could be further from the truth. Staff and researchers form bonds with our animals and care deeply about their well-being. In rare instances when there is an incident, we follow up with a deep root cause analysis to improve care and reduce future risk. Those who work with these magnificent animals are understandably distressed that their care and caring are being mischaracterized and misunderstood.\n\nClosing the center would be detrimental to the progress of biomedical research, the hundreds of people who work there, OHSU\u2019s finances and ability to fulfill its missions, and the lives impacted worldwide. And it would be expensive: Closing would likely cost more than $100 million to relocate more than 5,600 animals and other logistical hurdles, diverting resources that would otherwise fund our health care, education and research missions.\n\nClosing the center because of emotional appeals would also come at a time when scientific research is being undermined by the federal government. In an extremely uncertain future for science innovation, support for research \u2014 including that performed at the center \u2014 is more important than ever.",

      "title": "Cuts to Biomedical Research Will Cost Lives, Scientific Breakthroughs & Careers",
      "text": "In 2011, I, Deepti Pradhan, was diagnosed with breast cancer. A year of surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation followed, leaving lasting effects.\n\nIn December 2023, I, Christine Ngaruiya, got a call from my parents \u2014 my mother, a two-time breast cancer survivor, had something suspicious on a routine mammogram. My heart sank. As a physician, I knew a third breast cancer was unlikely \u2014 but I also knew what \u201csomething\u201d usually meant.\n\nFor both of us, these weren\u2019t just personal battles \u2014 they were fights made possible by biomedical research. The government\u2019s investment in science gave us more than time \u2014 it gave us precious moments with loved ones. Now, that lifeline is being severed.\n\nWe are not just a survivor and a caregiver \u2014 we are scientists. National Institutes of Health-funded (NIH) clinical trials shaped the treatments that saved our families. As a patient and a physician, we have directly benefited from medical advances, from chemotherapy to diagnostics. Yet today, that very research is at risk.\n\nAlmost 64 percent of deaths in the U.S. in 2023 were a result of noncommunicable diseases, with cancer and cardiovascular diseases being the leading causes. Despite this, the U.S. government is pulling back on research funding. The NIH, the world\u2019s largest public funder of biomedical and public health research, spent over $35 billion in 2023, generating an estimated $92.89 billion in economic activity and supporting over 300,000 researchers across 2,500 institutions.\n\nYet on February 7, 2025, the NIH announced a policy change capping \u201cindirect costs for grants at 15 percent.\u201d Indirect costs cover a plethora of core functions crucial to conducting the research and in the running of universities, such as paying for utilities to run laboratories, office space, setting up state-of-the-art and high-performance research facilities, supporting administrative staff to run research and other university programs, among others. These average roughly a third of total research funding, and this cap will leave $5 billion unavailable. That is equivalent to 0.6 percent of the U.S.\u2019s defense budget \u2014 a drop in the bucket for defense, but a catastrophe for biomedical research. The consequences will be far-reaching: fewer medical breakthroughs, more lives lost and shrinking opportunities for future scientists. Federal Judge Angel Kelley\u2019s March 5, preliminary injunction blocking the indirect costs cap was a positive step, but NIH research funding remains under threat. Some universities have already paused graduate admissions due to funding uncertainties.\n\nLike any investment, research funding has inefficiencies that could be refined. But cutting $5 billion from NIH while adding up to $150 billion to the already massive $850 billion defense budget is a reckless budgetary decision. At his confirmation hearing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to instill a \u201cwarrior ethos\u201d in the military. But if we keep slashing biomedical research and public health funding, no one will be safe.\n\nFor decades, academic institutions have laid the foundation for groundbreaking research, primarily funded by NIH. Now these same institutions face budget cuts that threaten to halt pivotal research. Were these cuts driven by scientific shortcomings, they might be understandable. But they are entirely political, guided by ideology rather than evidence. NIH-funded research has played a role in the development of 99.4 percent of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs from 2010 to 2019. Slashing new grants is one thing, but canceling funding for existing research is fiscal irresponsibility. Even if policy makers ignore the careers this will destroy, they should at least consider the millions already invested in near-complete projects.\n\nShrinking biomedical research funding weakens public health, strains the economy and threatens national security. A report from the Watson Institute for International & Public Affairs at Brown University highlights how prioritizing military spending has weakened other critical sectors of the U.S. economy. Investments in health care, education, infrastructure and emergency preparedness have all suffered as military interests take precedence. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to limit funding for biomedical research doesn\u2019t just affect cancer and cardiovascular disease research \u2014 it also undercuts epidemic preparedness, public health surveillance and basic scientific discovery. Cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service, which trains public health laboratory leaders; and Laboratory Leadership Service, which prepares disease detectives to respond to public health threats in the U.S., further weaken our frontline defenses \u2014 just as bird flu cases are rising and diseases are spreading across borders at unprecedented rates.\n\nRecent history proves that investment in science saves lives. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the power of research \u2014 from vaccine development to public health response. Yet misinformation and distrust in science prolonged the crisis. Now, we risk repeating history by cutting the very research needed to prevent the next global health emergency.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just policy \u2014 it\u2019s personal. It\u2019s about lives saved, moments cherished, and futures that hang in the balance. Advocating for public health funding, strengthening policies, combating misinformation, and pushing elected officials to prioritize science-driven policies is no longer optional. Staying informed and engaged is exhausting, but the alternative is worse. Call your congressional representatives. Demand better. Because science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. If we don\u2019t speak out, who will?",

      "title": "Tech expert: Trade agreements, not tariffs, would benefit US manufacturers and consumers",
      "text": "China announced on Friday that it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, the latest development in a back-and-forth trade war between the world's two largest economies and one that has shocked markets and raised fears of a global economic slowdown.\n\nJason Oxman, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents the world's most innovative tech companies, spoke with Scripps News about the burgeoning trade war and its likely effects.\n\n\"The concern here is that the trade policy needs to focus on a long-term strategic goal of entering into actual trade agreements. And that's where we hope the president will be focused moving forward,\" Oxman said.\n\n\"95% of the world's consumers live outside of the U.S. So for the economic success of American companies, having access to global markets is incredibly important,\" Oxman said. \"If we can move forward to entering into trade deals with our partners around the world, that would be great for U.S. manufacturing. Great for U.S. innovation, great for U.S. job creation.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | China strikes back: New tariffs on US goods as trade war intensifies\n\nChina responded in the trade war with the United States earlier this morning, announcing it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%. A Chinese finance official stated that President Donald Trump\u2019s most recent tariff increase on China to 145% \"won't create any economic damage\" and suggested it will become a \"joke in world economic history.\"\n\nLin Jian, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said China will simply ignore any future escalations in the trade war by President Trump, \"given that U.S. exports to China are already commercially unviable.\"\n\nThis has the potential to increase prices for consumers and rattle the international connections that deliver goods.\n\n\"Certainly companies are going to have to make decisions on their pricing based on the input costs of those units. You noted televisions as an example, televisions have not been manufactured in the United States for many, many decades. And it's a reminder that supply chains are global,\" Oxman said. \"I haven't heard any companies announced that they're going move television production back to United States. But I think that's an example of how U.S. consumers benefit from those global supply chains.\"\n\nOxman said he would prefer to see the U.S. take a more cooperative approach as new trade paradigms develop.\n\n\"Tariffs are a tool and in some cases can be useful. But they are no replacement for trade agreement. So the ideal scenario, as you noted, is we get back to negotiating trade deals with our partners, so that the EU and other international partners around the world see the United States as an ally in economic relations and that U.S. companies have access to those international markets.\"",

      "title": "Understanding Tariffs: How They Impact You And The Global Economy",
      "text": "Michael Ligon, Author, Serial Entrepreneur, Real Estate Investor, Stock Trader & cofounder of The Ligon Group.\n\nA tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imported goods and services. Countries use tariffs as a tool to regulate trade, protect domestic industries and generate revenue. When a foreign product enters a country, the tariff increases its price, making it less competitive against locally produced goods.\n\nMy interest in how macroeconomic factors impact real estate, business strategy and financial markets has led me to explore tariffs. While often viewed as political tools, tariffs influence supply chains, construction costs and investor sentiment. I hope this article helps business leaders, real estate investors and entrepreneurs navigate these complexities to help make informed decisions in today\u2019s global trade environment.\n\nHow Do Tariffs Work?\n\nGovernments apply tariffs as a percentage of the value of imported goods. For example, if the U.S. imposes a 10% tariff on imported steel, a shipment worth $1 million would face an additional $100,000 in costs. Importers must pay this fee, which often leads to increased prices for businesses and consumers. There are two main types of tariffs:\n\n1. Ad valorem tariffs: A percentage of the item\u2019s value.\n\n2. Specific tariffs: A fixed fee per unit of the item (e.g., $10 per ton of steel).\n\nBenefits Of Tariffs\n\nTariffs are often used strategically to achieve economic and political goals. Some key benefits include:\n\nProtecting domestic industries: By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs encourage consumers to buy local, supporting domestic businesses and preserving jobs.\n\nNational security: Certain industries, like defense and energy, are considered critical. Tariffs may help protect these sectors from foreign dependency.\n\nRevenue generation: Tariffs provide a source of income for governments, funding infrastructure, social programs and other national projects.\n\nTrade negotiation leverage: Countries can use tariffs as a bargaining tool in trade negotiations, pressuring trading partners to lower their own trade barriers.\n\nPolitical leverage: The mere threat of tariffs is often used in diplomatic negotiations, not just for trade but for other political and economic matters. Countries may leverage tariffs to gain concessions on unrelated issues such as intellectual property rights, environmental regulations or military agreements.\n\nNegative Effects Of Tariffs\n\nWhile tariffs have benefits, depending on how they are applied, the drawbacks can outweigh their advantages:\n\nHigher prices for consumers: Since importers pass the costs onto businesses and consumers, everyday goods like electronics, food and clothing can become more expensive.\n\nRetaliation and trade wars: When one country imposes tariffs, others may respond in kind, leading to escalating trade restrictions that can hurt businesses and workers globally.\n\nReduced competition and innovation: With less foreign competition, domestic companies may have less incentive to innovate and improve their products.\n\nEconomic slowdowns: Increased costs and decreased global trade can slow economic growth, affecting job markets and investment opportunities.\n\nSpecifically in real estate, tariffs can raise development costs, particularly in multi-family construction where materials like steel, aluminum and appliances are often imported. This can lead to:\n\nDelayed projects: Higher material costs may delay projects, impacting market supply.\n\nHigher rents: Landlords may pass on increased construction costs to tenants, affecting affordability.\n\nReduced profit margins: Investors could see lower returns due to higher overhead costs.\n\nHow Do Tariffs Affect Businesses?\n\nTariffs impact the price of goods you buy daily. If your country imposes tariffs on imported items like cars, electronics or groceries, expect higher prices at the checkout.\n\nFor investors, tariffs create uncertainty, affecting stock prices and economic forecasts. A sudden tariff hike can trigger market volatility and disrupt industries dependent on global trade.\n\nFor businesses relying on imported materials, tariffs raise production costs, forcing them to absorb the cost, raise prices or seek alternative suppliers. Therefore, anticipating tariff impacts is vital for staying competitive.\n\nKey strategies include diversifying supply chains to reduce exposure to tariff-sensitive regions. Here are some ways to do that:\n\nGeographic diversification: Sourcing materials from multiple countries to reduce dependence on one region.\n\nOnshoring and nearshoring: Bringing supply chains closer to home to avoid trade conflicts.\n\nSupplier negotiations: Building strategic partnerships to mitigate tariff-related cost hikes.\n\nFurther Strategies To Remain Competitive Amid Rising Tariffs\n\nWhen tariffs raise production costs, entrepreneurs and business leaders must adapt by embracing innovative strategies:\n\nValue engineering: Identify cost saving opportunities during the design and construction phase to reduce reliance on expensive imported materials.\n\nSupplier relationships: Strengthen relationships with local suppliers to negotiate better terms and diversify sourcing.\n\nProduct innovation: Focus on creating differentiated high value products that can absorb higher costs without losing competitiveness.\n\nDynamic pricing models: Use dynamic pricing to reflect changing costs, giving businesses flexibility in adjusting to fluctuating tariffs.\n\nAlternative Sourcing For Real Estate Firms\n\nPerhaps one of the the biggest factors for those in real estate and construction, tariffs on imported materials can have a direct impact on project budgets. To mitigate these effects real estate firms should consider alternative sourcing strategies:\n\nDomestic manufacturing: Explore local manufacturers and suppliers to reduce exposure to international tariffs.\n\nMaterial substitution: Consider using alternative materials that are not subject to tariffs without compromising quality or safety standards.\n\nRecycled and sustainable materials: Incorporate sustainable construction materials that are often less impacted by tariff fluctuations.\n\nRegional trade partners: Look to shift procurement to countries with favorable trade agreements to lower import costs.\n\nAre Tariffs Good Or Bad?\n\nTariffs are tools that must be used wisely. While they can protect domestic industries and jobs, they may also raise prices, trigger trade wars and slow economic growth. Their impact depends on how they are applied, the global trade environment, and a country\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\nIn commercial real estate, sectors like construction and manufacturing, reliant on imported materials, face higher costs from tariffs. However, domestic manufacturing and warehousing can actually benefit as companies move operations back onshore.\n\nOver time, tariffs have the power to reshape supply chains and impact multi-family development by boosting local sourcing and the demand for domestic suppliers and contractors; raising development costs; and shifting investment strategies, largely to sectors less affected by trade disruptions.\n\nOverall, for consumers, business owners and investors, staying informed about tariffs is crucial for making smarter financial and strategic decisions.",

      "title": "What are tariffs in simple terms and who pays them? Here's what to know Illinois",
      "text": "The headlines have been dominated by tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, trade imbalances and trade wars as the world markets respond to the chaos. Wondering what it all means?\n\nIn simpler terms, here's what to know.\n\nWhat are tariffs?\n\nLaunching a historic global trade war last Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced at least 10% tariffs for all countries with much higher rates for some countries or trading blocs. China was among the hardest hit with a 54% tariff, which has since retaliated as did Canada and the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us, so the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cI could have done that, I guess, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries and we didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nTrump cited examples such as instead of matching the European Union\u2019s 39% tariff on US goods, the new duty on the EU will be 20% instead. China, which was already slapped with a 20% tariff for its role in fentanyl trade, will be levied an additional 34% \u2014 half of the 67% tariff it imposes on the US \u2014 bringing its new rate to 54%.\n\nWho pays tariffs?\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods, imposed by the government, and is usually a percentage of the product's value.\n\nThe importing company \u2014 not the foreign government \u2014 pays the tariff to the government imposing the levy. So, if an item is valued at $100 and subject to a 25% tariff, the importer would pay $25 in tariffs.\n\nAs with any other tax, it increases the price of the product that is usually then passed on to the customer.\n\nTariffs are a form of trade regulation that governments use to protect domestic industries, such as agriculture and renewable energy or support local industries. They are also used to negotiate trade agreements and compete with other countries or retaliate against them when needed.\n\nWhat are retaliatory tariffs?\n\nRetaliatory tariffs are tariffs imposed by one country on goods imported from another country, in response to tariffs or trade restrictions imposed by that other country.\n\nAs the name implies, they are a 'retaliation' or form of punishment in effort to force a trade partner to negotiate or lower their tariffs.\n\nWhat is section 232 tariffs?\n\nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 empowers the president with authority to adjust imports being brought into the US in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nIn March 2018, during Trump\u2019s first administration, the president invoked authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1862) to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% tariffs on aluminum. These tariffs, including derivative products of steel and aluminum were reinstated and expanded effective March 12, 2025.\n\nAre tariffs good or bad?\n\nTariffs can raise money for the government and can help protect domestic industries from unfair competition.\n\nHowever they can also cause tension between counties and lead to trade wars that in turn lead to price increases for customers.\n\nWhat is a trade imbalance or deficit?\n\nA trade imbalance is caused when you export or import more or less than your trading partner. For example, in 2024 the United States total goods trade with China were an estimated $582.4 billion, broken down, the exports from the U.S. to China were $143.5 billion compared to $438.9 billion that was exported from China to US. The difference results in a trade imbalance with a trade deficit for the US and a trade surplus for China.\n\nMaria Francis is a Pennsylvania-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.",

While Manche was notably absent from a recent company offsite in San Francisco, he has disputed reports of his departure.\n\n\u201cVery much still at Movement. Missed company offsite because I was in Asia for Web3Festival,\u201d Manche said on X, refuting claims of an extended leave.\n\nManche also responded to speculation about his status on Slack, stating that he remains active and participates in weekly ecosystem calls. His Slack profile, which sources said was temporarily deactivated late last week, appeared to be reinstated by Monday evening.\n\nDespite the confusion, co-founder Cooper Scanlon continues to lead operational matters, assuring employees and the community that operations are normal.\n\nAs MOVE\u2019s price bleeds and community trust erodes, Movement Labs faces a crossroads. The third-party investigation may help rebuild confidence, but questions remain about internal controls, liquidity partner vetting, and the future of the MOVE ecosystem.\n\nBinance Crackdown and the Web3Port Connection\n\nWhile Binance did not name the entity, on-chain investigator ZachXBT pointed to possible ties to Web3Port. The firm had previously interacted with Movement Labs\u2019 social media and community channels.\n\nThis case adds to a growing list of questionable practices involving market makers in crypto, raising concerns about insider privileges, token dumping, and undisclosed conflicts of interest.\n\nBeInCrypto recently analyzed whether market makers are creating crypto chaos. The report highlighted how the lack of transparency and regulatory oversight allows some market makers to exploit their roles, often at the expense of retail investors.\n\nMoreover, Binance has recently banned other market makers over misconduct related to GPS and SHELL tokens. As it happened, one entity behind those abuses allegedly operated using shell companies, masking its involvement in multiple suspicious listings. This further reflects how widespread the issue may be.\n\nBest crypto platforms in Europe\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\neToro Explore\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nExplore\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nExplore\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nExplore\n\nBest crypto platforms in Europe\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\neToro Explore\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nExplore\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nExplore\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\nExplore\n\nBest crypto platforms in Europe\n\neToro\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\neToro\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\neToro\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThis is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nTake 2 mins to learn more\n\neToro\n\nYouHodler Wirex NEXO MEXC\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

The data also signals that investors are securing funds by investing in stablecoins rather than stocks as global markets are facing pressure amid trade war tensions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Decouples From S&P 500\n\nOn the other hand, an X post by DataDash revealed that Bitcoin is decoupling from the S&P 500. BTC and S&P 500 have shown correlated action, and following the Elliott Wave Theory, the assets reached their wave 5 highs earlier this month.\n\nHowever, a recent shift in the market sentiment since April 2 has ignited a massive tide of speculations. The S&P 500 witnessed a steep decline of over 10%, breaking key support at 5500 and yet to show signs of a clear reversal to date. Meanwhile, BTC price is down slightly over 5% from its high and is still holding above support levels. This dynamic further underlines signs of capital rotation wherein funds flow out of equities and move to the crypto market.\n\nAdditionally, this metric also indicates that a paradigm shift in market sentiment could occur shortly ahead despite the ongoing turbulence. The robust stablecoin inflows have only added to the chances of a bull market ahead. Now, market participants are eagerly awaiting risk assets to digest trade war tensions.\n\nBTC Price Stays Strong, Crypto Market To Follow?\n\nMeanwhile, despite the bloodbath on Wall Street, BTC price maintained trading above $85K and prevented any major losses. The flagship crypto consolidated within the $81K to $84K range over the past day. Bitcoin\u2019s resilient action in comparison to equities has left investors scratching their heads. Many experts even believe that the alt sector could mimic such a movement.\n\nA recent X post by attorney John E Deaton further shows intriguing data that underlines investors\u2019 shift of interest towards risk assets. The post indicated that while $3.25 trillion was erased from the U.S. stock market in just a day, $5.4 billion was added to the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: The presented content may include the personal opinion of the author and is subject to market condition.

      "title": "Bitcoin Price Likely To Follow Stock Market Movement After Trump\u2019s Tariff: Report",
      "text": "The Bitcoin price\u2019s resilience amidst the ongoing equity market correction has caught significant attention. However, experts warn that BTC\u2019s stability in the face of equity market correction is short-lived. As Matrixport highlighted, Bitcoin is expected to mirror stock market movements following Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill Bitcoin Price Sustain the Potential Stock Market Movement?\n\nIn a recent X post, crypto financial platform Matrixport shed light on Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the stock market. Though the pioneer cryptocurrency remained resilient amid the prevailing equity market downturn, analysts predict a possible market shift in the near future.\n\nNotably, analyst Markus Thielen expects the Bitcoin price to track stock market movements in light of Trump\u2019s upcoming tariff announcement. This could bring increased volatility to the market.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin\u2019s funding rates are only marginally positive, and retail trading volumes have dropped to summer 2024 lows. This trend suggests a cautious investor sentiment, with traders hesitant to make significant moves. As a result, analysts predict Bitcoin price will move in line with equities, presenting both opportunities and challenges for traders. However, considering the current market positioning, a significant beta-driven reaction seems unlikely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Will Trump\u2019s Tariff Plans Impact Crypto Market?\n\nFor context, Donald Trump is set to unveil the tariff plans today. This strategy may include reciprocal tariffs targeting 15 countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nSignificantly, Trump\u2019s potential move is expected to impact the crypto market, with assets like Bitcoin feeling the heat. The introduction of tariffs has pushed investors away from risk assets like cryptocurrencies, deepening the correlation between digital asset and traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Commenting on the matter, CoinPanel CEO Aran Hawker stated,\n\nMacro-driven correlations are increasingly shaping price action in major cryptos. The Nasdaq\u2019s role as a lead indicator in the current risk-off move offers a useful benchmark for attributing parallel weakness across the digital assets market.\n\nWill Bitcoin Price Bleed Post Tariff Announcement?\n\nBitcoin has been experiencing a rollercoaster ride over the past few weeks, hitting an all-time high of $108k and plummeting below $80k. Considering the strong correlation between Bitcoin and stock markets, analysts predict that BTC is poised for a major downturn following Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\n\nNonetheless, others argue that the tariff strategy could bolster Bitcoin price\u2019s long-term growth. According to Columbia Business School professor Omid Malekan, BTC could emerge as an alternative to traditional safe havens like gold. He noted, \u201cBitcoin has found footing in some circles as \u2018digital gold\u2019 and the physical variety is soaring on the tariff news.\u201d\n\nMalekan\u2019s statement comes in contrast with BTC critic Peter Schiff\u2019s dismissal of the crypto\u2019s title as the digital gold. Citing Bitcoin\u2019s volatility and inherent threats, Schiff addressed it as a digital risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: The presented content may include the personal opinion of the author and is subject to market condition.

      "text": "Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, said it \"offboarded\" a market maker for Movement's MOVE token with an association to another market maker that had been removed from the platform due to \u201cmisconduct.\u201d\n\nMarket makers are middlemen who are responsible for creating liquidity so trades can take place smoothly without big delays or price swings. They do this by quoting prices to both buyers (bid) and sellers (ask) and taking the opposite side to the transactions.\n\nThe market maker, which wasn't identified, made a $38 million profit when the MOVE tokens were first offered for trading on the exchange, Binance said Tuesday. Instead of meeting its obligations to ensure sufficient order size and place orders for both bid and ask prices, it placed sell orders for 66 million MOVE tokens one day after the initial listing and \u201clittle buy orders.\u201d\n\nOne-sided market-making activity is widely considered illicit and illegal, and Binance reiterated that strict rules are in place for defaulters.\n\nThe entity was offboarded on March 18, and both the Movement Labs and Movement Foundation teams were informed of the \u201cirregularities with their market maker,\u201d Binance said in the post. The market maker is no longer able to participate on the exchange and all proceeds were frozen to compensate users, whose details will be available at a later date.\n\n\u201cAny project-authorized market makers who do not comply with or breach such principles and rules, Binance will take further actions against such market makers to best protect our users,\u201d the exchange said.",

      "title": "XRP Bulls Stunned by 8,900% Liquidation Imbalance in One Hour",
      "text": "XRP witnessed a staggering 8,909% liquidation imbalance in just one hour, marking a shocking moment for traders in the cryptocurrency market. This extreme event saw a massive amount of bullish liquidations despite a relatively modest 2.7% price dip. Although this move was noticeable, it wasn\u2019t large enough to typically trigger such a dramatic liquidation imbalance.\n\nDespite the price movement being on the smaller side, nearly $1 million in long positions were wiped out, with $980,220 lost from bullish traders. On the other hand, shorts suffered only a minor liquidation of around $11,130. This imbalance between long and short liquidations is highly unusual, highlighting the amplified volatility and potential over-leverage present in the market.\n\nA Closer Look at XRP\u2019s Liquidation Event\n\nThe massive liquidation imbalance in XRP occurred at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market was also seeing significant liquidations. According to data from CoinGlass, over the past 24 hours, a total of $240.15 million worth of crypto futures contracts were liquidated. Of this, more than half \u2014 approximately $126.34 million \u2014 came from long positions. XRP, despite its relatively smaller price fluctuation, ended up as one of the top three assets by liquidation volume.\n\nBitcoin, as the market leader, saw the largest single liquidation with $4.76 million wiped from its futures contracts. However, XRP\u2019s sudden imbalance stood out due to the rapid scale at which long positions were closed out. This could point to an over-leveraged position from bullish traders who were too optimistic about XRP\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nA Sign of Market Sentiment or Over-Leverage?\n\nThe rapid liquidation event suggests more about market sentiment than the fundamentals of XRP itself. Bullish traders may have been betting on an upside scenario, possibly expecting stability or a rebound from key support levels that ultimately did not hold. This kind of extreme liquidation imbalance may be indicative of speculative trading, where excessive leverage was used in hopes of a quick rebound.\n\nSuch an event raises questions about whether this is a short-term market correction or the beginning of a broader shift in sentiment for XRP. While price movements like these are not uncommon in the volatile world of crypto trading, the scale of the liquidation imbalance certainly stands out. The fact that such a significant portion of XRP\u2019s futures positions were liquidated in just one hour speaks to a highly volatile and speculative trading environment.\n\nMarket Conditions and the Role of Leverage\n\nLeverage plays a crucial role in such extreme liquidation events. In leveraged trading, traders borrow funds to increase their position size, hoping to amplify gains. However, when the market moves against them, these positions are rapidly liquidated, causing even larger price swings. This can create a snowball effect, amplifying price movements that might otherwise seem modest.\n\nXRP\u2019s liquidation event is not just about the asset itself but also about the broader market environment. With significant market uncertainty, many traders may have been caught off guard by price movements, leading to panic liquidations. This market behavior points to the potential risks associated with high leverage in volatile conditions.\n\nLooking Ahead: Is XRP in for a Bigger Shift?\n\nWhile it is still unclear whether this liquidation event signifies a short-term correction or a more significant shift in market sentiment, the event has certainly raised eyebrows among traders and analysts. The sharp imbalance between long and short liquidations suggests a more cautious outlook among bullish traders who were caught by surprise.\n\nIf the broader market continues to experience volatility, XRP could face more challenges as traders adjust their positions. The next few hours and days will likely provide more insight into whether this liquidation event was a one-off occurrence or the beginning of a larger trend in the market.\n\nFor now, traders and investors will need to stay alert and consider the broader implications of market leverage and sentiment as they navigate XRP\u2019s price movements.",

      "title": "Pi Network Aims for $1 Amid Two-Week High: Will Bitcoin\u2019s Strength Carry it Further?",
      "text": "Pi Network\u2019s price has shown signs of recovery in recent days, reaching a two-week high after a notable uptrend.\n\nHowever, despite this progress, the cryptocurrency\u2019s growth appears heavily dependent on external factors, particularly Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. As a result, its future direction remains closely tied to the crypto king\u2019s performance.\n\nPi Network Could Keep The Uptrend Going\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests that while Pi Network\u2019s bullish momentum is beginning to fade, it has not yet reversed course. The indicator remains in positive territory, signaling that there is still potential for continued upward movement. The MACD is far from a bearish crossover, which could suggest that Pi still has room to rise in the short term.\n\nDespite a slight weakening in bullish momentum, the overall outlook for Pi Network remains positive. The current trend still shows that there is enough strength for the altcoin to maintain its uptrend and push higher, particularly if market conditions support its growth.\n\nPi Network has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin, standing at 0.84. This suggests that Pi closely follows the movements of Bitcoin, with its price trajectory highly influenced by the performance of the crypto market leader. As Bitcoin holds steady above $85,000, it could act as a strong catalyst for Pi\u2019s price growth.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing strength, Pi Network has the potential to experience a similar upward movement, especially if BTC continues to see positive price action. Pi\u2019s dependence on Bitcoin\u2019s market performance is evident, and any sustained rise in Bitcoin could trigger a corresponding rise in Pi Network\u2019s value.\n\nPI Price is Aiming At $1\n\nPi Network is currently trading at $0.74, up by 26% over the past five days. To maintain this positive momentum, Pi must hold above the $0.70 support level. A bounce off this level would allow the altcoin to continue its rise and potentially test the next resistance level at $0.87.\n\nIf Pi successfully breaches $0.87, it could open the door for further gains, with a potential move toward $1.00. The market sentiment and Bitcoin\u2019s continued strength could fuel this upward momentum, bringing Pi closer to its key target. A break above this resistance would signify the start of a more substantial rally.",

      "title": "Anti-Trump Protests Try to Reach the Newly Alarmed",
      "text": "Opponents of President Trump are planning protests on Saturday in all 50 states to oppose the president\u2019s slash and burn attacks on federal health care programs, and government workers, a message that they say appeals to a politically diverse set of Americans.\n\nThe mass action, \u201cHands Off!,\u201d was organized by Indivisible, MoveOn and several other groups that led protests about abortion rights, gun violence and racial justice during the first Trump administration. But organizers said they are now working with 150 local, state and national partners to emphasize a new message: President Trump is threatening health care, Social Security and education, making life harder for the average American, while benefiting his richest friends.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring in new people, and that\u2019s where Trump\u2019s policies are so consequential,\u201d said Britt Jacovich, a spokeswoman for MoveOn.\n\nLongtime Trump opponents are re-examining the huge protest movements that defined his first stint in office. The demonstrations minted new generations of activists and helped the Democrats retake the House in 2018, but they did not protect Roe v. Wade or compel Congress to pass police reform legislation. And in the end, Mr. Trump came roaring back in November and won the election.\n\n\u201cThe protests were effective in the short term, but in the longer term, unless there is some kind of resounding defeat politically, movements like Trump\u2019s are able to reconstitute and, in this case, win,\u201d said Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist who studies social movements and nonviolent resistance.\n\nSaturday\u2019s protests will surely include signs and speeches about reproductive rights, trans rights and racial justice. In other ways, the events may bear little resemblance to the mass demonstrations in Mr. Trump\u2019s first term, particularly the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which set the tone for the resistance. The day after his inauguration, more than half a million pink-hatted protesters descended on the nation\u2019s capital to watch Madonna perform and celebrities give keynote speeches, and millions more marched in cities nationwide.\n\nThe framing for the Saturday march is, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Trump\u2019s economic attacks and attacks on our rights,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, the co-founder of Indivisible. \u201cThey are not different things. They come from an anti-democratic alliance taking over and attacking fundamental parts of our democracy.\u201d\n\nMany of the half a million people who have signed up to participate in Saturday\u2019s marches will attend a protest close to home, including in places where Trump has been popular. The marquee rally on the National Mall could be comparatively modest, with a turnout in the tens of thousands. Politicians, labor leaders and political organizers have replaced Hollywood stars as keynote speakers.\n\n\u201cYou want the whole country involved in a protest, people in surprising places,\u201d said Jason Stanley, a philosophy professor who recently quit his job at Yale and fled to the University of Toronto. He said that mass movements gain staying power when they garner support beyond protest-friendly environments like liberal cities and college campuses. \u201cEveryone in a democracy has agency, but everyone has to feel like they have agency to use it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe results of the November election demand different opposition approaches, organizers said. In 2017, many opponents of Mr. Trump thought his victory was a fluke,so the strategy was to question his legitimacy. After Mr. Trump won the popular vote in 2024, his opponents began courting people he alienated within his coalition.\n\n\u201cEven people who initially said that Trump was doing what he promised he\u2019d do to his enemies, shaking things up, are now saying, \u2018What happened to me \u2014 what about me?\u2019\u201d said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cTrump also promised to help with groceries and help people get ahead, and he\u2019s making life harder and worse.\u201d\n\nGroups organized by Indivisible have hosted 150 town halls in Republican House districts. Many who attended were worried that Social Security and Medicaid were next on the chopping block. Concerned about the economic outlook, including rising costs for housing and food, they wanted to know why the billionaire Elon Musk was overseeing the government overhaul.\n\nElections in Florida and Wisconsin on Tuesday gave Democrats hope. In Florida, Republicans won two House seats by slimmer than expected margins. And a liberal candidate won election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. A variety of polls shows that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped.\n\n\u201cReality has hit in a way it didn\u2019t during his campaign,\u201d Ms. Jacovich of MoveOn said.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s deportations, investigations and university funding cuts have helped subdue dissent.",

      "text": "I\u2019M JESSICA BROWN IN FOR KAREN HOLMES WARD. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS MAKING GOOD ON ITS PROMISES. DOWNSIZING THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY AND LAUNCHING IMMIGRATION SWEEPS HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MANY OF THESE MOVES ARE BEING MET WITH PUSHBACK, SOME TAKING DIFFERENT FORMS. PROTESTERS ARE HOLDING WEEKLY DEMONSTRATIONS AT TESLA\u2019S SHOWROOMS, AND SALES HAVE DROPPED 13% AS CEO ELON MUSK SLASHES THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE. NEW JERSEY SENATOR CORY BOOKER GAVE A RECORD SETTING 25 HOUR SPEECH IN OPPOSITION TO THE ADMINISTRATION\u2019S POLICIES, INVOKING THE IDEALS OF THE LATE CONGRESSMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER JOHN LEWIS. AMERICANS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF USING THEIR VOICES TO COUNTER POLICIES AND EVENTS THAT THEY SEE AS UNFAIR, UNJUST, OR IN SOME CASES, ILLEGAL. A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO IMPLEMENT CHANGE. THE STORIES OF RESISTANCE ARE THE SUBJECT OF A NEW BOOK CALLED A PROTEST HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES BY GLORIA BROWNE MARSHALL. GLORIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY. WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE NOT ONLY AN ACCOMPLISHED AUTHOR, BUT A SOCIAL JUSTICE ATTORNEY, A PLAYWRIGHT, AND A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. AND THIS BOOK IS VERY TIMELY GIVING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT\u2019S BEEN HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY AS OF LATE. WE KNOW THAT THERE\u2019S BEEN REGULAR PROTESTS OVER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u2019S POLICIES. SO HOW IS THE CHRONICLE OF STORIES IN YOUR BOOK AND HOW THEY\u2019RE HIGHLIGHTING? HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING NOW? WELL, IT\u2019S MEANT FOR WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING NOW, BECAUSE THERE\u2019S ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IT\u2019S ALWAYS REQUIRED THE POWER OF PROTEST. AND I THINK IT\u2019S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE TIMES ARE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TIMES IN THIS COUNTRY, FROM BASIC RIGHTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE BECAUSE OF PEOPLE PROTESTING LITIGATION, LEGISLATION, PROTESTS EQUALS SOCIAL CHANGE. NOW, WE DON\u2019T HAVE VIDEO, RIGHT? FOR ALL OF THE, YOU KNOW, DECADES AND DECADES OF PROTESTS THAT WE\u2019VE SEEN NOW IN YOUR RESEARCH, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OR WHAT HAS STUCK OUT TO YOU AS SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT, THAT YOU SEE NOW? WHAT I SEE NOW IS AN IMPATIENCE, AND THE IMPATIENCE IS WITH THE PROCESS OF PROTEST. BEFORE REGULAR PEOPLE KNEW THEY COULD GO OUT INTO THE STREETS AND HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD, THE FIRST AMENDMENT OFFERS US FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY. BUT MOST PEOPLE DON\u2019T KNOW. THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. THAT\u2019S THE LAST LINE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT, A RIGHT TO PETITION. ASK THE GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS. REMEDY OF GRIEVANCES, COMPLAINTS. SO WE\u2019VE ALWAYS HAD THAT RIGHT. SINCE 1791. BUT, YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE RELY ON IT MORE OFTEN THAN OTHER POINTS OF TIME. WE NEED TO GO BACK TO RELYING ON ASKING OUR GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS OUR GRIEVANCES, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO GAVE US ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE WAKE UP WITH AND TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY, THEY GAVE IT THROUGH PROTEST. YOU MENTIONED ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS IMPATIENCE. THAT\u2019S AN INTERESTING WORD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU\u2019RE SEEING OUT THERE TODAY, THINK ABOUT THIS. THE EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY. WE TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. THAT WAS IN LEGISLATION IN THE 1800S. WE FINALLY RECEIVED IT IN THE 1900S. THAT WAS THROUGH PROTEST AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE LAW WAS ON THE BOOKS, BUT THE EMPLOYERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS REFUSED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY. SO NOW WE TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. IF WE WOULD HAVE SAID ONE AND DONE, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW WITH PROTEST, I WENT OUT FOR A PROTEST ONCE AND I DIDN\u2019T GET WHAT I WANTED. AND SO I DON\u2019T THINK PROTEST IS EFFECTIVE. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FROM WHERE WE SEND OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, TO OUR WORK DAY, TO THE FOOD WE\u2019RE EATING WITH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. EVERYTHING WE HAVE WAS BASED ON PROTESTS AND LITIGATION. IT TOOK TIME FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. IT DIDN\u2019T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND PEOPLE WANT AN OVERNIGHT SOLUTION. I THINK THAT\u2019S KIND OF OUR CULTURE, RIGHT? WE WANT THINGS DONE QUICKLY, RIGHT? WE WANT QUICK RESULTS. THE NEXT DAY. LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROTESTS, BECAUSE WE\u2019RE ALSO SEEING ECONOMIC PROTESTS RIGHT THROUGH BRAND BOYCOTTS AS WELL AS PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS BASED ON THE HISTORY OF PROTESTS. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE MOST IMPACTFUL FORM? THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROTESTS AROUND DIFFERENT ENTITIES. BRANDS THINK ABOUT WHEN DOLPHINS WERE BEING CAUGHT IN THE TUNA FISH NETS. PEOPLE STOPPED EATING TUNA BECAUSE THEY WERE PROTESTING THE KILLING OF THE DOLPHINS. THE TUNA INDUSTRY CHANGED THE WAY IT STARTED TO CATCH THE FISH. THAT WAS A BOYCOTT. THAT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. IT DIDN\u2019T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT, BUT IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TYPES OF BOYCOTTS LIKE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SELECTIVE BUYING, IS WHAT I LIKE TO CALL IT AS WELL. AND DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, IT WAS DON\u2019T SHOP WHERE YOU CAN\u2019T WORK SOMETHING THAT SIMPLE. AND SO PEOPLE JUST DID NOT SHOP AT CERTAIN STORES THAT, YOU KNOW, HAD SEGREGATIONIST VIEWS. SO THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD, YOU KNOW, EVEN BASIC THINGS JUST DON\u2019T DO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, LIKE WALK A FEW MORE BLOCKS. WHY GO SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU\u2019RE DISRESPECTED? I ALWAYS SAY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL BOYCOTT INDIVIDUAL PROTESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GO TO A PARTICULAR STORE AND THEY DISRESPECT YOU, DON\u2019T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY. THAT\u2019S VERY SIMPLE. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ANYBODY CAN DO. AND THAT\u2019S WHAT THE OTHER PART OF THIS BOOK IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY CAN DO WITHIN YOUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR. YOU CAN NOT BUY A BOOK. OR IF THEY\u2019RE BANNING THE BOOK, BUY THAT BOOK. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE A, YOU KNOW, BOOK READING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. IF THE BOOKS ARE BANNED IN THEIR SCHOOLS. THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TAKE A STAND. ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, YOU EXPLORED THE HISTORY OF MOVEMENTS AND REBELLION IN, IN THE U.S. WHICH STORY FOR YOU MOVED YOU THE MOST? PART OF IT WAS, AND I WENT TO WEST VIRGINIA AND I WENT UP TO COAL COUNTRY, WEST VIRGINIA. NOW, HERE\u2019S THE SAD PART. I WENT UP TO COAL COUNTRY, WEST VIRGINIA WITH A FRIEND. I HAD JUST COME BACK FROM AFRICA BY MYSELF, BUT I WASN\u2019T GOING TO COAL COUNTRY, WEST VIRGINIA BY MYSELF. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES LEFT OVER DEALING WITH, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE CAN AND CANNOT GO IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, EVEN THROUGH PROTESTS, WE\u2019RE STILL IN SITUATIONS IN WHICH WE FEEL WE HAVE SUNDOWN TOWNS IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL, YOU KNOW, THE FREEDOM RIDERS. SO GOING TO COAL COUNTRY, I DEALT WITH, YOU KNOW, THE COAL WARS IN WHICH THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DIED IN COAL MINING ACCIDENTS. SO THEY HAD TO FORCE THE COAL MINING COMPANIES TO GIVE THEM BASIC PROTECTIONS. AND BECAUSE THE THE COAL MINES OWNED THE SCHOOLS, THEY OWN THE HOMES, THEY OWNED ALL THE LAND. IF SOMEONE STOOD UP AND WANTED TO JOIN A UNION, THAT PERSON WAS TERMINATED. THEY HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOME. THEY HAD TO LEAVE THEIR SCHOOL. THEY EVEN OWNED THE CHURCH. THE COAL COMPANY DID. SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND UNIONS WERE A FORM OF PROTEST. AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT\u2019S MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES ECONOMICALLY IS THE UNION AND THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES DECIDED TO STAND TOGETHER AND DEMAND THAT THEY HAVE CERTAIN TREATMENTS AND PROTECTIONS ON THE JOB AND HAVE A FAIR WAGE, THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PROTESTS HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT. THE PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN THEY TAKE FOR GRANTED. THERE WAS NO, YOU KNOW, GIANT, BENEVOLENT, YOU KNOW, PERSON WHO SAID, YES, HERE, HAVE A HAVE A UNION. NO UNIONS WERE FOUGHT FOR AND PEOPLE DIED TO CREATE UNIONS. AND THEN THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TURN AROUND AND SAY, WE DON\u2019T WANT PROTESTS ARE PART OF A UNION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY OF PROTEST. IN ORDER TO GET THAT REUNION. AND ANOTHER REASON WHY IT\u2019S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE HISTORY AS WELL, TO APPRECIATE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOW. SO NOW WE KNOW PEACEFUL PROTESTS ARE PROTECTED SPEECH. AND IF YOU ASK IMMIGRANT RIGHTS GROUPS, IMMIGRANTS ARE ALSO COVERED UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. BUT NOW WE KNOW WITH THIS, THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING A HARDER LINE, RIGHT? REVOKING STUDENT VISAS BECAUSE OF FOREIGN STUDENTS VIEWS. THIS IS A BIT OF A SHIFT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

      "title": "Social worker imprisoned nearly 4 years for mediation attempts at Hong Kong protests",
      "text": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 A Hong Kong social worker was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison Wednesday on a charge of riot for her role in the 2019 anti-government movement, in a case that signals the authorities' stern approach to protest-related acts.\n\nJackie Chen was among a group of social workers who often carried a loudspeaker seeking to mediate between police and protesters during the often-violent social unrest. While she had been acquitted in her first trial in September 2020, prosecutors successfully appealed the verdict. She was convicted following a retrial.\n\nIn March, judge May Chung rejected Chen's claim of being a mediator in her verdict. She said Chen had continuously shouted unfounded accusations against the police during a protest in August 2019 and had used her social worker role, claiming to be \u201csafeguarding justice,\u201d to back the protesters.\n\nHanding down the sentence on Wednesday, Chung noted Chen did not resort to violence at the scene, but her sentencing would have to consider what the whole crowd was doing at the site. She pointed to the serious circumstances of the riot.\n\nThe judge initially set the sentence at 5 years but reduced it after considering factors like the pressure facing Chen over the long legal proceedings and her contribution as a social worker.\n\nIn Chen's mitigation letter posted by local media, she said 2019 was a crucial turning point in her life, with many social workers wanting to provide emotional support during the protests. She said even though she knew the government had planned to appeal against her acquittal in the first trial, she never thought of leaving the city because she wanted to continue her service for the people who are in need.\n\nShe said she felt especially guilty toward her 75-year-old mother, whose health has deteriorated in recent years. She hoped the judge could allow her to reunite with her family earlier.\n\n\u201cAlthough many people say I am a good social worker, I am truly an unfilial daughter,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhen she entered the courtroom, her supporters in the public gallery waved at her. She smiled and nodded back.\n\nThe social worker's conviction drew attention because of her mild role in the 2019 protests. The movement, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nChen could also lose her social worker license. Last year, the government amended the law to allow the removal of a social worker\u2019s name from the register if he or she has been convicted of an offense that is punishable with imprisonment and may bring the profession into disrepute.\n\nIn the same hearing, three other defendants received jail terms of two years and five months each for rioting. They had been initially acquitted but the government successfully appealed. They then chose to plead guilty.",

      "title": "'Hands Off!' Protests Held Across the Twin Tiers, Part of National Movement",
      "text": "ITHACA, N.Y. (WENY) -- Across the country, people came together on Saturday, April 5 for the \"Hands Off!\" rallies to protest against President Trump, his administration's recent policies, and more. Some of those protests happened right here in the Twin Tiers.\n\nOver 1,000 mass mobilization \"Hands Off!\" events were held across the country on Saturday with hundreds of thousands of people standing together and chanting words of protest such as \"Hands off,\" and \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\n\"They are not alone,\" said Amala Lane, lead of the art team at Indivisible Tompkins. \"There are thousands and millions of us united together. You can hear them in the background, we make a louder noise and bigger impact together.\"\n\nHere in the Twin Tiers, protests took place in both New York and Pennsylvania. In the Keystone State, protests were held in Sayre and Mansfield. New York saw protests held in Owego, Corning, Hector, and Ithaca.\n\nThe Ithaca Commons held a massive crowd of people who were seen holding signs, political artwork, and more. People could also be heard honking their horns as they drove by.\n\nAttendees at the Corning protest said hundreds of people came out to that rally as well.\n\nOrganizers of the Ithaca rally joined other local protestors who say they are calling \"Hands Off!\" on a variety of social justice, economic, and human rights issues. Protestors voiced anger over the Trump Administration's moves to close Social Security field offices, fire federal workers, dismantle the Department of Education, lessen access to reproductive and transgender healthcare, and more.\n\n\"So we have merged ourselves with this rally and so basically we're hoping to basically have a community day of action that brings many different groups together and unites us all in our mission of accomplishing our political goals,\" said Lucas Bonet, one of the co-organizers of the protest.\n\nBonet said he has been on the Commons with fellow activists every Saturday at noon for a month straight. This event happened to coincide, allowing the groups to join forces.\n\nProtestors in the region say they won't stop until they see a decrease in what they call government overreach from Trump, Musk, and the current administration.\n\n\"It can be frightening to show your face,\" said Jeffra Ruesink, the coordinator of the rally, and the engagement chair with Indivisible Tompkins. \"I think a lot of the administration's actions are designed to make us feel like we should stay home. We might be at risk if we speak out, and what I would want everyone to know is that when we stand together, we are safer, we're more secure and we help our brothers and our sisters and our neighbors.\"\n\nSome attendees at the Corning rally have posted on social media saying that counter-protestors were present at local rallies too. Those counter-protestors spoke out in favor of the Trump Adminstration, standing by his administration's latest policies.",

      "text": "Six miles of added lanes on I-4 will open the week of April 28, 2025.\n\nThe project, the first of several intended to improve traffic flow on Interstate 4, will open eight months ahead of schedule.\n\nComing to I-4 are several more improvements, including new ramps, bridges, and more new lanes.\n\nNobody likes sitting in traffic.\n\nAnd ranking right up there is the frustration of road work that seems to drag on forever.\n\nSo mark this on your calendar: construction of \"congestion relief lanes\" on one of the busiest sections of Interstate 4 has finished ahead of schedule.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis announced this week that 6 miles of added lanes on I-4 will be completed eight months ahead of schedule.\n\nHere's what is going on.\n\nWhere are the new 'congestion relief lanes' on I-4?\n\nThe new lanes, one additional lane in each direction of I-4 from U.S. 27 in Polk County to World Drive in Osceola County, will be open for use beginning the week of April 28, DeSantis said.\n\n\"The new lanes will be located on the inside of the existing I-4 mainline to provide motorists with congestion relief,\" FDOT said.\n\nThe project is being completed eight months ahead of schedule.\n\nHow was the I-4 project completed so fast?\n\nAfter DeSantis directed the Florida Department of Transportation to deliver immediate congestion relief along I-4, the department \"used an innovative construction approach to open new lanes early.\"\n\nFDOT launched the Moving I-4 Forward program and introduced a new streamlined method called Modified Phased Design-Build, a news release said.\n\n\"Benefits of using this pioneering process include reduced project timelines, travelers spending less time in traffic, fewer taxpayer dollars being spent, and a continued focus on innovation,\" FDOT said.\n\nIn practical application, on the section intended to open the week of April 28, construction crews paved the inner breakdown lanes, converting them to traffic lanes.\n\nThe approach allowed new lanes to open \"without waiting for full project completion. These lanes will remain open through all future construction,\" FDOT said.\n\nAre more traffic projects planned to ease congestion on I-4?\n\nYes. The Moving Florida Forward program includes nearly 700 projects across Florida, with $75 billion in infrastructure investment committed since 2019, a news release said.\n\nFDOT listed these projects after the new lanes open the week of April 28:\n\nAccelerated Start phase: Segment A: I-4 from east of U.S. 27 to west of S.R. 429. 4.1 miles. Segment B: I-4 from west of S.R. 429 to east of World Drive. 3.4 miles. Highlights include:\n\nExpand I-4 to accommodate up to 12 total lanes at the ChampionsGate Boulevard (C.R. 532) and World Drive interchanges. These additional lanes will consist of up to eight general use lanes and four express lanes (for future use).\n\nProject 1: East of World Drive to east of U.S. 192. 2.6 miles. Highlights include:\n\nThree general-use lanes and two new express lanes in each direction.\n\nMaintain existing access to State Road (S.R.) 417 from the general-use lanes onI-4. A\n\nNew ramps will connect the S.R. 417 toll to the I-4 express lanes.\n\nReplace toll plazas on S.R. 417.\n\nProject 2: East of C.R. 532 to west of World Drive. 3.1 miles. Highlights include:\n\nImprovements to the State Road (S.R.) 429 interchange, which currently ends at I-4.\n\nFour general-use lanes and two express lanes in each direction.\n\nNew ramps will be built to connect the express lanes on I-4 to S.R. 429 and from the I-4 general-use lanes to S.R. 429.\n\nOld Lake Wilson Road will be widened from Sinclair Road to Assembly Court and over I-4 from two to four lanes with sidewalks and bicycle lanes on both sides, including building a second bridge.\n\nProject 3: West of U.S. 27 to west of ChampionsGate Boulevard (C.R. 532). 3.4 miles. Highlights include:\n\nAdding two express lanes in each direction along I-4.\n\nAdding ramps to connect I-4 express lanes and U.S. 27.\n\nProject 4: West of Osceola Parkway to east of World Center Drive (S.R. 536). 2.1 miles. Highlights include:\n\nAdding two express lanes in each direction along I-4.\n\nAdding ramps to connect the express lanes and S.R. 536.\n\nExisting I-4 bridges at the Osceola Parkway interchange over Bonnet Creek will be reconstructed.\n\nProject 5: Poinciana Connector from C.R. 532 to S.R. 429. 3.5 miles. Highlights include:\n\nExtending the Poinciana Connector from where it ends near U.S. 17 to Osceola Polk Line Road, County Road (C.R.) 532.\n\nThe I-4 project will continue and connect south of the interchange with S.R. 429.\n\nFinal configuration of the new road includes three lanes in each direction with the ability to expand to four lanes in each direction.\n\nRamps connecting to Osceola Polk Line Road (C.R. 532) will be included.\n\nWhat is the Moving Florida Forward initiative?\n\nDeSantis announced the Moving Florida Forward initiative last year at a news conference in Polk County. The program includes nearly 700 projects across Florida.\n\nThese projects will \"deliver much-needed congestion relief 10 to 20 years ahead of the original schedule,\" according to FDOT's website. The projects are intended to:\n\nStrengthen resilient infrastructure for future growth.\n\nImprove travel times by reducing congestion.\n\nIncrease safety and connectivity.\n\nEnhance the quality of life for the community.\n\n\u201cWe launched the Moving Florida Forward initiative to accelerate major transportation projects that reduce congestion and improve connectivity,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\n\u201cWith nearly 700 projects underway and $75 billion in infrastructure investment since 2019, we\u2019re delivering real results for Floridians and keeping Florida moving.\u201d",

      "title": "\u2018On Budget, On Time\u2019: Sean Duffy Says This Is How Trump Will Make Infrastructure Projects More Accountable",
      "text": "Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy appeared on Newsmax Wednesday and described President Donald Trump\u2019s infrastructure strategy and said that projects under his administration will be both financially responsible and timely.\n\nTrump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries, excluding China, which will face a 125% increase. This caused markets to surge in response. During an appearance on \u201cCarl Higbie Frontline,\u201d Duffy discussed how leveraging tariff revenues could support infrastructure initiatives and said they\u2019re going to make Trump\u2019s infrastructure projects much more accountable.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned the California high-speed rail. It\u2019s been 16 years and $16 billion. Not one track is laid. You have nothing for it. Liberals love trains, and liberals love subways and public transportation,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cLook at New York. It is dirty. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s violent. People don\u2019t want to ride that. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you were liberal and you could say \u2018I\u2019m going to make this a beautiful experience and a really safe experience for the New York or New Jersey rider\u2019\u201d?\n\nDuffy said the Trump administration is committed to real results over political gain.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do with President Trump, we are going to invest in the great projects that will be built, that will be on budget, on time, and move people. It\u2019s really simple stuff. And these boondoggles, like in California, where people get rich and nothing is ever built, we\u2019re done with that,\u201d Duffy told Higbie. \u201cIt\u2019s making the American people rich with great infrastructure, not politicians\u2019 spouses.\u201d\n\nDuffy said infrastructure plays a critical role in a thriving economy and added that Trump is deeply invested in building.\n\n\u201cThe president loves coal, beautiful clean coal. He loves all infrastructure because, again, it moves our people and our products around the country,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an advanced economy without great infrastructure, and the president recognizes that Democrats \u2014 though they spend a lot of money on, in air quotes, infrastructure \u2014 it never gets built. This president wants to build big, beautiful roads and bridges and rail and ports and ships.\u201d\n\nDuffy then described Trump\u2019s vision for enhanced airports and a new air traffic control system.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\u201cHe wants beautiful airports, safe airplanes, a brand-new air traffic control system. How the transportation system works is how the economy functions, and the president loves this stuff. He gets it,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nDuffy commented on the economic strategies supporting these initiatives, including leveraging tariff revenues.\n\n\u201cThe president brought this up in the Oval [Office]. Bringing in $2 billion a day plus plus is what he said, in tariff revenue. And, again, this is gonna be at 10% globally. We\u2019re gonna bring in a massive amount of money. We\u2019re gonna protect American workers and, by the way, the president stands up with the men and women who make the products in this country. They make this country work,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s high-speed rail project, initially estimated at $40 billion to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, now requires an additional $7 billion by June 2026 to prevent further delays. The project\u2019s costs have escalated to over $100 billion, and the Bakersfield-Merced line is not expected to be complete until at least 2030.\n\nCalifornia has spent about $14 billion on the high-speed rail project and needs to invest at least $28 billion more to complete the Bakersfield-Merced line, with $600 million already used on environmental reviews. The project, which includes ongoing pre-construction planning in the Bay Area, cleared all necessary environmental hurdles for the Los Angeles-San Francisco line only in 2024.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Newsmax)",

      "title": "City Projects That Improve Biking and Walking Are on Trump\u2019s Latest Hit List \u2013 Mother Jones",
      "text": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has ordered a review of federal funding for bike lanes and plans to target recent projects that \u201cimprove the condition for environmental justice communities or actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nThe move, outlined in a department memo obtained by Grist, is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader goal of steering federal infrastructure spending toward fossil fuels. The restriction of federal funding comes as health experts warn that pedestrian deaths have surged.\n\nDOT officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe undated memo, reportedly sent March 11 to DOT offices, ordered an immediate freeze on all grants made after January 2021, invoking a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling federal diversity and climate initiatives. It instructs agency employees to identify projects that provide \u201cfunding to advance climate, equity, and other priorities counter to the Administration\u2019s executive orders.\u201d\n\nIt specifically targets any funds for projects \u201cwhose primary purpose is bicycle infrastructure,\u201d one of many steps President Donald Trump has taken to boost the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIt also calls for flagging projects that might prioritize benefits to disadvantaged communities or reduce emissions. This likely includes hundreds of grants awarded through Safe Streets and Roads for All, a $5 billion initiative created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The goal of these efforts is to help communities address roadway safety concerns, said John Tallmadge, the executive director of Bike Durham, a nonprofit group in Durham, North Carolina. The group is supporting a series of infrastructure improvements in Durham that were counting on funding from the agency\u2019s BUILD grants, also expected to be impacted.\n\nThe Durham project would add sidewalks, crosswalks, and bus stops to the city\u2019s busiest transit corridor, which is used by thousands of people each day. \u201cNumerous locations along this corridor have had pedestrian fatalities,\u201d Tallmadge said.\n\nThese safety concerns were highlighted in a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found Americans were 50 percent more likely to die walking in 2022 than in 2013. Its author, Rebecca Naumann, said infrastructure that prioritizes safety over speed\u2014like the improvements Durham hopes to build\u2014are proven solutions that protect everyone.\n\nShe notes such designs have helped other high-income countries like Austria, Canada, and the UK, reduce traffic deaths in recent decades. The opposite is true of the United States, which as of 2022, saw more pedestrian deaths than any of the 27 other countries Naumann studied.\n\nOne DOT project manager, who requested anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, told Grist the memo and executive orders will make it \u201cterribly difficult to use federal transportation dollars where it\u2019s needed most.\u201d That\u2019s bad news for more than bike lanes: Sustainable transportation not only makes communities safer, it lowers travel costs; improves access to important services like medical care, schools, and work; and helps mitigate climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to see these solutions stall when so many communities urgently need them,\u201d he said. As Tallmadge noted, delays and revisions to federal grants will increase the cost of any project\u2014the opposite of government efficiency.\n\nOther funding likely to be caught up in these restrictions include projects within the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program, which supports multimodal travel; the BUILD program, which is designed to meet local or multi-jurisdictional needs; and the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program, which helps communities harmed by past transportation decisions. Grants recently awarded under these initiatives range from $22 million for electric buses in Rhode Island to $157 million for green spaces that connect Atlanta neighborhoods currently divided by highways.\n\n\u201cThe restriction of funding for projects like the Atlanta BeltLine and its RAISE Grant is an assault on disadvantaged communities,\u201d said US Representative Nikema Williams, the Democrat who represents a wide swath of Atlanta. \u201cThese projects improve equity and mobility while spurring economic development.\u201d\n\nThe DOT memo follows recommendations outlined in the conservative Project 2025 policy agenda that has shaped much of the Trump administration\u2019s work. It broadly argued that the federal government should not fund local transportation projects. Instead, it suggests \u201cuser fees\u201d and enabling \u201cprivate companies to charge for transportation\u201d through ventures like toll roads, removing air pollution regulations, restricting electric vehicle infrastructure, and eliminating federal funding for bicycle lanes, ferries, and other transportation.\n\nYet the move to restrict programs like BUILD, which rely on community input, clashes with Project 2025\u2019s emphasis on local decision-making, said Caron Whitaker, the deputy executive director of the League of American Bicyclists. The Atlanta BeltLine project, for example, was supported by private and public entities at almost every level of government in Georgia. \u201cWhy are we pulling back grants where local governments choose what they want to do?\u201d Whitaker asked. \u201cIf safety is a federal issue, then local fatalities matter,\u201d she added. \u201cIf the economy is a federal issue, then local economies matter.\u201d\n\nThe League, which is circulating a petition protesting the DOT\u2019s review, recently led meetings with congressional aides to discuss the importance of funding active transportation projects. One former DOT employee who spoke to Grist said the scale of Safe Streets and Roads for All means there will be widespread impacts. \u201cSafety is a bipartisan issue. You see Republican and Democratic representatives and senators touting the announcement whenever they\u2019re awarded,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people just think, \u2018Oh, this probably just hurts the coasts and the big cities,\u2019 but there\u2019s definitely rural areas that were trying to improve safety.\u201d\n\nIt takes a lot of work for communities to get a federal grant, he said, often alongside finding matching funds. Whitaker agreed. \u201cIt puts local governments in a tough position,\u201d she said. Because the Safe Streets program funding was congressionally allocated, explicitly including \u201cbicyclists,\u201d Duffy\u2019s move to cut programs \u201cwhose primary purpose is bicycling\u201d may not even be legal. Last week, a coalition of nonprofits and cities sued to reverse the federal freeze on grants, including the March DOT memo. \u201cSince our nation\u2019s founding, the Constitution has made it clear,\u201d wrote the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is litigating the case, that \u201cCongress controls federal spending\u2014not the president.\u201d\n\nThese efforts may limit transportation research nationwide. The DOT funds research and technical assistance projects through the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, or NCHRP, which is also subject to review. \u201cIf the policy memo is applied broadly to NCHRP, there could be a significant loss in current and future funding,\u201d said Jennifer Dill, director of the Transportation Research and Education Center. \u201cWithout more research about countermeasures and solutions to fatalities, it will be hard to reverse that trend.\u201d She worries Duffy\u2019s recent actions will limit states\u2019 ability to effectively use federal money for local priorities.\n\nAt headquarters, morale among many of those remaining at the DOT is at new lows. At first, the DOT project manager who spoke to Grist hoped to come up with ways to rephrase grants to avoid triggering words like \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cclimate.\u201d But the new restrictions have escalated into an unprecedented level of scrutiny, with the political appointees reviewing every contract.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone beyond just switching words to get through the censor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only making people afraid to carry on with good work that was underway, but has a chilling effect on everything we do going forward.\u201d",

      "title": "Building prosperity: How infrastructure economics tracks growth and development",
      "text": "Infrastructure economics provides project owners, communities and policymakers with the tools and data needed to make compelling business cases for infrastructure investment. Those cases are built on job creation, workforce productivity, changes in commuting habits, rural and urban development, community well-being and other elements.\n\nEvery federal, state and local election brings a new set of requirements and economic priorities that reshape infrastructure programs. Despite these changes, the fundamental principles of economic analysis remain constant. Economists must consistently focus on identifying and quantifying the most relevant data to accurately understand the value of a project and secure stakeholder support. These assessments also help create a compelling case for investment and ensure programs move from concept to implementation.\n\nBy quantifying the impacts of new or upgraded programs \u2013 from transportation systems to energy grids \u2013 infrastructure economics quantifies the economic and social impacts of infrastructure projects. By analyzing costs, benefits and trade-offs, economists can help policymakers and stakeholders make data-driven decisions that maximize societal benefits.\n\nMoving projects forward\n\nIn the short term, infrastructure investments can stimulate economic activity, create jobs and improve service delivery. For example, constructing a new airport or port facility can generate immediate employment opportunities and enhance trade efficiency. Over the long term, these investments contribute to ongoing economic development by fostering innovation, attracting businesses and enhancing competitiveness.\n\nEconomic analyses play a key role in promoting funding strategies. By integrating economic insights into grant and other funding applications, organizations can highlight the broader impact of proposed infrastructure projects, which in turn improves their competitiveness for funding opportunities. In an economic analysis conducted by Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads Transit, for example, the agency found that an 80 percent increase in bus service hours would result in a $2.10 return for every dollar invested in improved bus service.\n\nA well-structured economic analysis provides quantifiable evidence as to how a project contributes to job creation, regional development and cost savings over time. Ultimately, leveraging infrastructure economics in grant applications enhances credibility, maximizes funding impact and supports effective investment decisions.\n\nEconomics at all stages of the project life cycle\n\nInfrastructure economics can be deployed at every stage of a project\u2019s life cycle, facilitating efficient planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance.\n\nEach project phase accentuates different priorities. For example, in the planning and environmental stage, the emphasis is on strategy development. Economic principles can guide strategic planning by identifying high-impact investments and assessing economic and environmental trade-offs. A thorough understanding of economic implications allows projects to align with community growth objectives. When the Texas Department of Transportation incorporated an economic analysis into its Lampasas Relief Route Feasibility Study, the department examined how a relief route for through traffic coupled with downtown streetscape improvements can impact employment and earnings. The study found the project would create over 200 jobs and nearly $12 million in earnings annually.\n\nDuring design, the focus of an analysis shifts to data-driven decision-making. Infrastructure economics plays a crucial role in optimizing project configurations to ensure cost efficiency and support economic development priorities. Leveraging data-driven insights helps minimize waste and enhances design effectiveness. In Boston, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) leveraged the findings of a benefit-cost analysis that was prepared as a one-page handout about the North Station Draw One Bridge Replacement and submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) as a funding application. The handout conveyed the significance of the project to decision-makers and stakeholders, and the MBTA received a $472 Mega grant award for the project from USDOT.\n\nIn the construction stage, an analysis prioritizes quality control, risk management and cost-effective solutions. Economic principles help manage budgets, prevent cost overruns and optimize resource allocation. By applying infrastructure economics, projects can be delivered on schedule and within budget while maximizing long-term value.\n\nDuring the operations and maintenance stage, the goal of an economic analysis is asset life and performance maximization. Ongoing economic analysis ensures optimal asset performance, extends lifespan and minimizes maintenance costs, supporting long-term economic viability and efficiency.\n\nComprehensive economic analysis tools for infrastructure success\n\nA comprehensive approach to infrastructure economics relies on various analytical techniques to assess project viability and optimize decision-making. A few approaches include:\n\nBenefit-cost analysis ensures that resources are allocated efficiently by comparing a project's benefits against its costs.\n\nEconomic impact assessments examine how infrastructure investments influence employment, income levels and business activity.\n\nFinancial planning evaluates funding strategies, cost structures and revenue models while input-output modeling analyzes sectoral interactions and broader economic effects. Life-cycle cost analysis considers long-term expenses\u2014including maintenance and operations\u2014to enhance financial planning.\n\nMarket assessments determine the demand and feasibility of new infrastructure investments, and policy analysis explores the regulatory and policy implications of projects.\n\nPrioritization analysis helps rank projects based on their economic and social benefits while real estate and economic development analysis assess how infrastructure influences property values and urban growth.\n\nRisk assessment identifies potential financial, environmental and operational risks, ensuring that infrastructure investments are resilient and well-informed.\n\nUltimately, infrastructure economics provides the analytical tools necessary to measure the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and societal benefits of infrastructure investments that allow society to function. By integrating economic principles into every stage of the project life cycle, decision-makers can ensure that infrastructure investments optimize resource utilization to promote economic growth, enhance quality of life and optimize resource utilization.\n\nWhether supporting short-term economic objectives or driving long-term regional development, infrastructure economics remains a cornerstone of strategic planning and viable growth.",

      "text": "(The Center Square)\u2212 The Louisiana Legislature kicked off the 2025 regular session by approving a slate of major highway construction projects proposed by the state Department of Transportation and Development.\n\nThe list of approved projects spans key locations across the state, including Hammond, Bridge City, Lafayette, Monroe, Lake Charles, Bossier City, Alexandria, Chase and Baton Rouge.\n\nWhile the Legislature has the authority to reorder project priorities, it may not add new projects or substitute those that have been removed.\n\nDOTD\u2019s construction budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year totals $1.11 billion, covering 323 projects scheduled for letting which is the process of soliciting construction bids.\n\nDOTD Secretary Joe Donahue said the program has shifted since its initial presentation in October due to delays stemming from unforeseen issues.\n\n\"We didn't know about them in October, but in between October and now those were identified as potentially delaying them,\" Donahue told The Center Square. \"So [we] put them on the list. Likely next year will be when they're back up, because hopefully those issues will have been resolved.\"\n\nTo reduce the financial burden on taxpayers, Donahue said DOTD frequently coordinates with private investors. For example, Meta will cover the full cost of infrastructure upgrades in Richland Parish.\n\n\"We are there early, whenever these things are announced, whenever an infrastructure need is identified, and have periodic meetings as those negotiations progress and beyond that,\" Donahue told the Joint Transportation, Highways and Public Works Committee.\n\nAccording to DOTD, 138 projects have moved into the construction phase and are no longer listed in the program. Other key changes include:\n\nSeven projects originally scheduled for letting in FY 2025-2026 have been accelerated and will now be let in the current fiscal year, FY 2024-2025.Fifty-two projects planned for FY 2024-2025 have been pushed to FY 2025-2026.Eighty-four projects were reclassified from Stage 4 (ready for letting) to Stage 3 (design and development).Three projects were canceled.One project was marked as completed, meaning construction was handled by DOTD district forces or another entity.Three projects were merged into other existing projects to streamline planning and avoid delays.Eighteen new projects were added to Stage 4, scheduled for letting in FY 2025-2026.\n\nDOTD noted that not all 18 of the newly listed Stage 4 projects may appear in the final program due to adjustments in funding or project scope.",

      "title": "Duffy to lay out transportation funding plan amid cutback push",
      "text": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is set to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to pitch the Trump administration\u2019s take on the next big transportation and infrastructure bill as GOP lawmakers mull topline infrastructure funding levels.\n\nDuffy, who will appear at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is operating under the broader Trump administration directive to end spending on green and equity programs featured in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and otherwise greatly scale back federal outlays.\n\nThat law added $550 billion in new spending \u2014 such as new discretionary grant programs for transit, rail and funding for EV charging equipment \u2014 to what would\u2019ve otherwise been a traditional surface transportation reauthorization bill. Republican lawmakers have called for a return to tradition when the current authorization expires in 2026. As Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves, R-Mo., put it, that means \u201claying asphalt, pouring concrete, building bridges and building roads.\u201d\n\nAlthough Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., voted in favor of the 2021 law, she has argued that the Biden administration\u2019s implementation of certain programs was slow or, in other cases, overreaching.\n\n\u201cThese programs require significant time and money from eligible applicants, and once a grant has been awarded, the project grant agreement was often taking more than a year to be negotiated and signed by the prior administration, which delays the benefits of each project,\u201d she said in a hearing last month.\n\nCapito\u2019s goals for the bill revolve around \u201coptimizing\u201d federal investments in transportation, boosting efficiency and avoiding \u201ctop-down mandates\u201d by allowing states more leeway with surface transportation funding, she said in an op-ed this month. She added that \u201coptimizing\u201d federal investments will include eliminating \u201cduplicative programs that often invite regulatory overreach\u201d and increasing funding for formula programs instead. That is likely to be popular among states that have urged lawmakers to transfer funding from discretionary grant programs to formula funding accounts, which they argue is more reliable and allows for better long-term planning.\n\nCapito added that lawmakers will consider streamlining the current environmental review processes for transportation and infrastructure projects, which critics have said is too lengthy and bureaucratic, as well as other inefficiencies in procurement and grant requirements.\n\n\u201cThe vision I\u2019ve laid out is broad, but that\u2019s intentional,\u201d Capito said in the op-ed. \u201cWe must always be pragmatic, and work in a bipartisan fashion to develop a bill in the Senate that sets us up for a productive conversation on this reauthorization effort across both chambers of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe topline amount the bill will provide is still up in the air. Jim Tymon, executive director of nonprofit American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, said in an interview that the increased funding levels provided in the 2021 infrastructure law created a new baseline, and that lawmakers need to continue to fund transportation projects at that level.\n\n\u201cWithout this landmark legislation, states would have had to scale back projects due to the rising cost of inflation,\u201d Tymon said. \u201cAs a bipartisan initiative, we believe that reauthorization would lead to many more success stories as state DOTs work to advance projects and build and maintain a transportation system that works for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe Transportation Department, however, has already paused funding for certain programs. Department officials said formula funding for states hasn\u2019t been paused, but DOT has suspended funding for some discretionary programs related to bike infrastructure, vehicle charging and other programs related to climate change and equity.\n\nIn a \u201creport card,\u201d the American Society of Civil Engineers rated the nation\u2019s infrastructure an overall grade of a \u201cC,\u201d an improvement from a \u201cC minus\u201d in 2021. The report identifies federal investments from the infrastructure law and others as positively affecting infrastructure in many sectors.\n\nThe group added that, if Congress were to continue current funding levels over the next 10 years, the nation would still face a $3.7 trillion funding gap to reach a \u201cstate of good repair.\u201d Reverting to traditional spending levels would significantly worsen that gap, it said.\n\n\u201cThese big, significant infrastructure projects can take that long to construct if plans and permits are ready to go the second that money comes out,\u201d Darren Olson, who chairs the organization\u2019s Committee on America\u2019s Infrastructure, said in a statement. \u201cIt will be critical to continue this federal leadership and investment to prevent backsliding.\u201d",

      "title": "Editor's Notebook: America\u2019s public transit infrastructure improving thanks to federal investments",
      "text": "The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave the U.S.\u2019s public transit infrastructure a \u2018D\u2019 grade in its 2025 Report Card for America\u2019s Infrastructure\u2014a slight improvement from the previous \u2018D-\u2019 rating in the 2021 assessment. While transit tied with stormwater for the lowest-scoring category, transit\u2019s progress reflects the positive impact increased federal funding can have on the industry\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) delivered $108 billion to help agencies address deferred maintenance while breaking ground on new capital projects. IIJA funds also played a critical role in helping agencies stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic as ridership plummeted throughout the country. However, ASCE flagged that nearly 92 percent of pandemic federal aid had been spent as of December 2024. If there is no new financing for operations, then increased fares, reduced service, deferred maintenance and canceled capital projects may become the new norm.\n\nFor instance, while ASCE reported the percentage of revenue vehicles and infrastructure assets in a state of good repair were relatively level\u2014with facilities showing a slight improvement\u2014substantial funding gaps remain to bring all assets into a state of good repair. ASCE calculates the industry will need $20.3 billion annually if it\u2019s to achieve a state of good repair by 2038. When accounting for transit\u2019s total infrastructure needs, the number jumps to $618 billion.\n\nWhile funding delivered through IIJA has made a noticeable difference, gaps remain due to years of deferred maintenance that will require continued investment to ensure transit systems remain safe, reliable and equipped to meet evolving needs. ASCE estimates that between 2024 and 2033, the transit sector will face a $152 billion shortfall. Driving this shortfall are rising costs and increased sustainability and resiliency demands while grappling with limited funding for operational support.\n\nSome of these shortfalls can be addressed through the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization. In addition to ensuring robust and predictable long-term funding is in the next reauthorization, there may also be policy modifications to consider.\n\nFor example, one of ASCE\u2019s recommendations to boost transit\u2019s score is to support funding flexibility, so agencies can use funds for operations, maintenance, state of-good repair and planning across all asset classes. Other policy modifications have called for using formula-based funding instead of discretionary funding for certain programs, refining the permitting process to speed up capital project delivery, as well as streamlining environmental review processes.\n\nHowever, without broad advocacy, full funding levels and policy modifications that will help public transit may not happen. It\u2019s imperative that Congress understands not only the necessity but also the benefits of investing in public transit. One of the best ways to accomplish this? The power of storytelling. Numbers are compelling, but as one of our best practices columnists writes, they don\u2019t paint a holistic picture of how an agency contributes to its community. Don\u2019t underestimate how stories can resonate with your stakeholders. Use them to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d and demonstrate the transformative role transit can play when it receives the investment it deserves.",

      "title": "AI Is Changing Consumer Apps: Here's What That Means For Innovators",
      "text": "Achraf Golli, Co-founder of Quizard & Unstuck AI.\n\nBringing a consumer application from idea to launch was once a slow, resource-intensive process. While the core mechanics of product development haven't changed, how we address the speed, accessibility and personalization within the apps has seen significant changes in recent years.\n\nToday\u2019s consumer apps are smarter, more adaptive and capable of scaling at unprecedented speeds\u2014not just because of incremental technological improvements, but because AI has proven to be an effective accelerator for application development.\n\nAs someone building AI-powered consumer products in edtech, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how this shift is rewriting the competitive landscape. Lean teams can build applications that rival those of industry giants, thanks to AI\u2019s ability to automate development, refine user experiences and amplify marketing reach.\n\nLet's explore how AI is redefining consumer applications from development efficiency to user experience to go-to-market strategies.\n\nFast-Tracking Product Development\n\nBuilding a consumer-facing application once required months, if not years, of engineering effort, extensive testing and costly infrastructure. AI is changing that: Development cycles are shrinking and automation is becoming the norm.\n\nThe first major shift has been in development tools, with Gartner projecting, as cited by Oracle, that wider adoption of GenAI code assistants could result in over 36% productivity growth. Products like GitHub Copilot and Cursor have outgrown their labels as \"autocomplete tools,\" now suggesting optimizations, debugging and even generating entire code functions.\n\nThis has transformed software development from a time-intensive endeavor into a highly iterative process where developers focus on solving high-impact problems rather than writing boilerplate code.\n\nThe testing phase\u2014once a major bottleneck\u2014is also seeing a radical upgrade. Testing frameworks can now autonomously detect bugs, automate regression testing and simulate real-world user interactions at a future-looking scale. What used to require dedicated QA teams and prolonged beta cycles can now happen in parallel with development, allowing applications to launch faster and with greater stability.\n\nA Force Multiplier for Startups\n\nBy reducing engineering overhead and automating the most important development functions, AI is also changing who gets to compete. Early-stage startups no longer need massive engineering teams to build high-quality applications.\n\nInfrastructure optimization, AI-assisted coding and automated customer support mean that lean teams can punch above their weight, focusing resources on innovation rather than operational bottlenecks.\n\nAnother major accelerator is the availability of open-source AI models. Instead of building AI from scratch, developers can fine-tune powerful models like Meta\u2019s LlaMa and, more recently, DeepSeek's R1 model, for specific use cases.\n\nThis democratization of AI means cutting-edge functionality is no longer exclusive to tech giants. Independent developers and startups can now integrate advanced AI without deep machine-learning expertise or massive research and development budgets.\n\nA New Standard For Value Creation\n\nConsumer expectations have never been higher. They want digital experiences that feel personalized, interfaces that anticipate their needs and interactions that are seamless.\n\nAI is making these expectations a reality. AI-powered analytics suites, for example, enable applications to actively learn from user behavior. From content recommendations to dynamic UI adjustments, AI models optimize user experiences based on concurrent feedback and engagement patterns.\n\nYou don't need to look far to find examples:\n\n\u2022 In EdTech, adaptive learning pathways are replacing one-size-fits-all curriculums, dynamically adjusting based on student engagement to improve learning outcomes.\n\n\u2022 Playlists on music apps evolve based on listening habits, refining suggestions with quick, sustainable iteration to keep users engaged.\n\n\u2022 Writing-suggestion tools can adapt to a user\u2019s style over time, making its feedback more relevant and effective.\n\n\u2022 AI-powered design can make suggestions to help users quickly create and iterate on tried-and-true content.\n\nBut there needs to be a fine balance to avoid AI overload. Poorly integrated AI can add unnecessary complexity, frustrating users and hurting retention. Voice assistants, for example, excel in hands-free accessibility but often feel out of place in applications where they add interactive friction rather than value.\n\nMore concerning is the rise in \"AI washing,\" where companies may add an AI label on features that add little value. The best AI-powered applications strike a balance: They automate and personalize in ways that feel useful and important to the product, never making users feel like they\u2019re wrestling with a machine.\n\nHarnessing Momentum From Social Media\n\nEven the best-built applications will struggle to find traction, though, without effective distribution. AI is on both sides of the equation, changing how products are marketed and who gets discovered.\n\nWith over a quarter of U.S. adults regularly using social media platforms, TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have rewritten how digital products find users. Their algorithms are oriented less toward social graphs, focusing instead on surfacing content based on engagement signals. This has leveled the playing field, allowing small brands and indie developers to go viral without massive ad spend.\n\nInstead of pouring money into paid ads, successful consumer applications now grow through AI-driven organic reach, influencer partnerships and algorithmic virality. To take advantage of this trend, successful product marketing should prioritize:\n\n\u2022 Create platform-native, highly engaging content. Content that feels organic to a platform\u2019s ecosystem is more likely to be promoted by its AI-driven algorithms.\n\n\u2022 Leverage the creator economy. Influencer partnerships can\u2014and often do\u2014amplify reach more effectively than traditional advertising.\n\n\u2022 Optimize for engagement over impressions. High engagement rates signal relevance, making AI-driven algorithms more likely to surface your content.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Next Gen of Consumer Apps\n\nFor founders and innovators, AI is opening new doors across development, user experience and distribution:\n\n\u2022 For developers, intelligent development tools are removing technical barriers, making it easier than ever to launch sophisticated applications.\n\n\u2022 For users, native personalization and intelligent feedback systems are making applications smarter, more intuitive and more valuable.\n\n\u2022 For marketers, algorithmic platforms are leveling the playing field, allowing innovative products to go viral based on engagement rather than budget.\n\nThe most impactful applications in the coming years will make AI a core pillar of their product strategy. The companies that leverage AI to create quickly iterative, sticky and engaging experiences will be the ones that define the next generation of consumer technology.",

      "title": "IBM Launches Z17 Mainframe With Full AI Integration",
      "text": "IBM launched the latest version of its dominant mainframe platform \u2014 the z17 \u2014 at its virtual IBM Z Day event this week. The z17, which features comprehensive AI integration, is designed to bring AI workloads closer to enterprise data. Embedded AI accelerators within its microprocessors support predictive and generative AI models alongside AI-powered security features. The z17 also leverages AI for critical system functions such as tuning and management. It is scheduled to be generally available in mid-June of this year.\n\nLast month I received an advance briefing on the z17\u2019s capabilities during an analyst event held at IBM\u2019s new headquarters in New York. The new rollout builds on the success of the predecessor in the Z lineup, the z16, which debuted in 2022 and delivered consistent revenue growth, showing the enduring value of IBM\u2019s mainframe offerings half a century after the technology became widespread. \u201cThis has been one of the longest-running and most consistent programs in terms of revenue growth we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d noted IBM\u2019s CFO James Kavanaugh on the company\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call.\n\nNate Dotson, principal product manager for IBM z17, framed the strategic direction for the launch: \u201cThe z17 presents new possibilities, evolving how enterprises can utilize their core systems through AI, automation and enhanced security. Our focus is on three key areas: supporting innovation and growth with AI, enabling automation and transformation for efficiency, and enhancing the security of critical data.\u201d AI advancements for mainframes can improve and secure business interactions, leading to faster, more reliable, personalized consumer experiences. This is particularly important because many everyday consumer transactions rely on mainframe technology, including most credit card purchases as well as other steps in financial transactions such as identity verification.\n\n(Note: IBM is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\n\nThe Staying Power Of The Mainframe\n\nDespite common misconceptions about mainframes being relics of a bygone era, they remain a significant component of the modern IT landscape. Mainframes are widely recognized for high reliability, scalability and performance, which is what allows a technology that became common during the Cold War to support today\u2019s technologies and hybrid infrastructure models. They manage substantial volumes of critical business data and process a considerable portion of the world\u2019s transactional workloads. The IBM Institute of Business Value reports that 79% of IT executives consider mainframes essential for enabling AI-driven innovation and value creation. Modern mainframes offer significant processing power, handling up to 30,000 transactions per second, and can accommodate substantial data with up to 40 terabytes of memory. Economically, 75% of IT executives report that mainframes are equal to or better than cloud computing in terms of total cost of ownership.\n\nAccording to IBM, organizations that integrate mainframes into a hybrid-by-design strategy achieve a 3x higher ROI from their digital transformation efforts. The overwhelming majority (88%) of executives from the same study believe that modernizing mainframe applications is critical for achieving long-term success in digital transformation.\n\nHow It\u2019s Done: Enhancing Core Operations With Integrated Intelligence\n\nThe z17 incorporates several new AI-related features, including the ability to use multi-model AI in real time by combining AI models and LLMs for every transaction. Integrating multiple AI models enables deeper analysis and understanding of transactional data, increasing predictive accuracy by uncovering patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed. And real-time processing ensures that decisions such as flagging suspicious transactions or approving loans are made instantly. In the case of a financial institution, this could lead directly to faster and more accurate fraud detection, credit risk assessments and anti-money-laundering measures. This protects both customer accounts and the institution itself while also improving customer experience, for example by enabling quicker loan approvals. The expanded insights and accuracy also help meet stringent regulatory requirements by ensuring thorough transaction monitoring.\n\nMeanwhile, retailers can explore generative AI models on the mainframe to refine customer interactions and recommendations. Airlines rely on mainframes to manage booking systems and ensure smooth customer service, while insurance companies use them to process high volumes of claims efficiently.\n\nIn industries dealing with high volumes of transactions, mainframes\u2019 extreme scalability for rapid processing can result in better customer satisfaction and retention. The new ability in the z17 to process AI tasks on the mainframe is intended to further improve latency, potentially leading to quicker service responses. The IBM Z environment also addresses key data privacy and compliance considerations. The inherent scalability of mainframes ensures consistent service during peak demand, while the built-in resilience is designed for zero downtime.\n\nThe AI infrastructure within the z17 aims to improve efficiency in AI workloads and offer enhanced throughput compared to some distributed GPU models. IBM has enhanced the z17 with the Tellum II Processor AI Accelerator, a second-generation accelerator integrated into the processor for complex computations associated with LLMs. Its architecture supports relevant computational primitives, facilitates remote AI access across the system and optimizes compute capacity through new data types. The Spire Accelerator, a dedicated AI accelerator available on a PCIe card, will be available as an add-on for z17 in Q4 2025. Designed for generative AI tasks, it has 32 cores and 128GB of LPDDR5 memory. Its architecture allows for clustering, which increases processing capacity. The accelerator supports both 4-bit and 8-bit processing for efficient execution of LLMs, reducing the need to move sensitive data off-platform.\n\nTina Tarquinio, vice president of product management at IBM, emphasized the strategic imperative behind this AI integration. \u201cIBM isn\u2019t just adding AI for technology\u2019s sake, but is purposefully engineering AI capabilities to enhance the most critical business operations,\u201d she said. \u201c90% of the world\u2019s credit card transactions run through the mainframe. 70% of the world\u2019s [financial] transactions, by volume, run through the mainframe. We need the AI where it matters most, and for all of our clients, it needs to happen fast, it needs to happen reliably and it needs to happen securely. And this is what we\u2019ve built the stack for.\u201d\n\nSecurity And Efficiency In Intelligent Computing\n\nBecause mainframes process such vast amounts of transactions, data security is paramount. IBM Z has historically provided a robust environment for sensitive data, and the integration of AI should bolster this capability. By processing AI workloads on-chip or within the Spire accelerator, the z17 enhances security by keeping sensitive data within the mainframe environment. The mainframe\u2019s encryption capabilities extend to AI operations, making the environment especially suited for highly regulated industries such as financial services and healthcare.\n\nThe z17\u2019s local processing could also lower costs by minimizing reliance on external computing resources. Mainframes have a history of providing value for enterprises by enabling them to process enormous amounts of data while keeping costs remarkably low. One indicator of this: despite handling 72% of global transaction workloads, mainframes account for only 8% of IT costs.\n\nCost is only one consideration. IBM designed the AI features in z17 to focus on efficient energy utilization, which is becoming increasingly critical as AI strains energy resources and impacts carbon footprints. The new infrastructure is intended to lower energy consumption for AI workloads compared to some traditional methods \u2014 and to the z16 \u2014 which could help organizations better manage operational costs and address environmental considerations.\n\nThe Ongoing Evolution Of Mainframe Technology For Enterprise Computing\n\nIBM views AI integration into the IBM Z platform as a crucial step in the ongoing evolution of enterprise computing. In this context, IBM plans to further enhance AI capabilities for the Z platform while continuing to integrate it with hybrid cloud environments \u2014 and to explore quantum computing.\n\nTo support the adoption of these AI capabilities on the mainframe, IBM is actively developing and offering upskilling and training programs as well as strategic partnerships. The company\u2019s Z Mainframe Skills Depot provides different learning paths and training for various roles in the mainframe ecosystem. Currently, it covers roles including system admin and application developer, with plans to expand to include a security-focused learning path in the future.\n\nBecause a significant portion of the mainframe workforce is reaching retirement age, upskilling and training programs are critical for building a new generation of professionals. By 2035, many experienced workers will have retired, creating a pressing need to transfer knowledge and expertise to younger talent. These initiatives are essential for maintaining operational continuity and enabling businesses to fully leverage AI capabilities on the mainframe. IBM\u2019s professional development and community programs are similar to Broadcom\u2019s Vitality Residency Program, which my colleague Matt Kimball wrote about last year. This trend of supporting mainframe talent development is a testament to the staying power of the technology and its importance in data processing.\n\nThe Future Of Experience Built On Intelligent Infrastructure\n\nAlthough consumers may not directly engage with mainframes or fully comprehend their operational role, their influence remains significant. As the unrivaled dominant player in the mainframe market, IBM and its Z platform play outsized roles in the ongoing relevance and innovation of mainframes. Ultimately, these systems facilitate rapid transaction processing at great scale, personalized service delivery and secure business interactions, while also contributing to sustainable operations. For many businesses prioritizing good customer experience alongside effective risk and cost management, IBM Z represents a critical infrastructure component.\n\nAs IBM continues to integrate intelligent features that can influence the future of customer experience, it\u2019s essential to recognize evolving perceptions of the mainframe. In the AI era, it may well become a foundational element for modern customer experience and business operations.",

      "text": "Dennis Lister, Senior Vice President of Product and Innovation at Emirates, said in an interview with Gulf News on Tuesday at the International Air Transport Agency\u2019s (IATA\u2019s) World Cargo Symposium that the \"consumer-to-consumer,\" or C2C, service is a bit more complex due to regulations surrounding personal deliveries.\n\n\"We are not doing that just yet, but it will come next year,\" he said, urging readers to \"Watch this space.\"\n\nThe service launched in 7 key markets earlier this month, including the UK, the Middle East, all GCC countries, and South Africa. \u201cLooking forward, we're onboarding Australia. India is the next big market. We're also looking at China as a massive market, and eventually the US,\u201d said Lister. According to Lister, this phased approach is necessary because developing and implementing these services takes time, resources, and personnel.\n\nHe said that Emirates Courier Express initially focuses on its most important and frequently used routes. They didn't launch globally immediately because setting up operations worldwide is complex and requires building partnerships in each location. Their strategy involves an \"asset-light\" approach, meaning they rely on local partners in each market for package pickup and final delivery.\n\n\u201cThe operating model we've created is on a partner-based model, what we call \"asset-light,\" even though we're an asset-heavy company. But we're in the market, we're using the local final mile and first-mile delivery capability of the partner in that market,\u201d he explained.\n\nProviding a timeline for near-term expansion, Lister revealed that Australia is a priority market and is set to launch \"in the next month.\" India will follow soon, with the US and China likely next in line, though he cautioned that this order could change. \"Priority for us is going to be Australia... India will follow soon, and then we will start working on the US and then China in that sort of order, which may change. So, don't hold me to it,\" he said.\n\nWhile EKSC currently operates in around 10 destinations, Lister clarified that the focus is on reaching airport destinations rather than just countries. He explained that launching services in a single country can immediately add multiple destinations, citing South Africa and Australia as examples.\n\nLister also said the company aims to reach all 148 destinations served by its parent airline, Emirates. \u201cI think our goal is going to be to try and hit 148 destinations we fly to,\u201d Lister stated, emphasizing the long-term ambition.\n\nIn the near term, the focus for the next one to two years will be on \"stabilizing\" current operations, improving efficiency, accelerating growth, and expanding into more markets. Lister also highlighted the intention to broaden the range of services offered by EKSC, including the delivery of specialized items such as \"medical samples or vaccines, etc., or specific oncology drugs to certain patients.\"\n\nCommenting on whether Emirates Courier Express has been launched to capitalize on the region\u2019s e-commerce boom, Lister said, \u201cWhat you're seeing in today's world is more and more people are buying stuff online. I don't think we can catch the entire e-commerce market, and that's not the goal. This (EK Courier Express) is a premium product that will focus on customers who want things delivered quickly. Because if you look at the trends today, people want stuff delivered quickly.\u201d\n\nLister said Emirates plans to offer door-to-door solutions to retailers. \u201cThe delivery time can be cut short by providing it on our passenger fleet, because we have so many flights operating from the key markets,\u201d he explained.\n\nEmirates, for example, operates more than 138 flights a week from the UK. \u201cThis will enable us to connect quickly on any of those flights into the Middle East or beyond.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lister, the Emirates Courier Express service was designed to be multifaceted. \u201cI would not want to pigeonhole it to one industry. It's\u2014it's vertical, it's multi-vertical. So, in other words, it can be anything from technology, pharmaceuticals. It could mean one day we're delivering blood, we could be delivering samples of vaccines, etc.\u201d he added.\n\nThe service delivers technology, pharmaceuticals, food or fresh products, and cold chain. \u201cA range of different products we can deliver in a range of different verticals we're going to approach. It's not one industry-specific. Multi-industry is the goal,\u201d he added.",

      "title": "T\u00fcrkiye lambasts Greek maritime spatial planning",
      "text": "The Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) by Greece has pitted the country against T\u00fcrkiye. Ankara on Wednesday hit out at a \"unilateral\" move by its neighbor amid a dispute over rights in the Aegean Sea.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that certain areas included in the MSP declared as part of the EU acquis violated T\u00fcrkiye's maritime jurisdiction in the Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\"We would like to emphasize that Greece's unilateral moves and claims do not bear any legal consequences for our country. We would like to remind Greece that countries should abstain from unilateral actions in the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas and international maritime law encourages cooperation between littoral states, including on the environment, and remind that we are always ready to cooperate with Greece in the Aegean Sea,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Such actions and attempts on fait accompli will never have legal consequences for our country. T\u00fcrkiye safeguards its stance for the need to adhere to a sincere and comprehensive approach based on international law and good neighborliness for the solution of issues, in the framework of the Athens Declaration for Friendly Relations and Good Neighborliness dated Dec. 7, 2023, that reflects the spirits both sides are willing to sustain,\" the statement said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Greek media reported that Athens issued its MSP, citing that it exercised its rights under international laws.\n\nAnkara and Athens seek to improve relations after years of hostilities, but maritime jurisdictions remain a thorny issue. The countries that came close to an all-out war in the 1990s over the Aegean Sea remain vigilant, with T\u00fcrkiye concentrating on developing a domestic defense industry. Greece relies on foreign partners to boost its defenses. An agreement on where their maritime zones begin and end is important for determining rights over possible gas reserves and power infrastructure schemes. T\u00fcrkiye, which has the longest continental coastline in the Eastern Mediterranean, rejects the maritime boundary claims of Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration, arguing that their excessive claims violate the sovereign rights of both T\u00fcrkiye and the Turkish Cypriots in the region.\n\nThe dispute over the waters dividing the neighbors arose again last year between T\u00fcrkiye and Greece when Athens announced that it would build two marine parks in the Aegean and Ionian Seas by the end of 2024, despite objections by T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThe plan for the park in the Aegean has irked Ankara, which has accused Athens of exploiting environmental issues to push a geopolitical agenda. Greece\u2019s Foreign Ministry retorted that Ankara was \u201cpoliticizing a clearly environmental issue.\u201d\n\nThe Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the country adopted the National Spatial Strategy for Marine Zones, essentially specifying the MSP, and defined it as an important initiative.\n\n\"The MSP constitutes a holistic spatial planning framework and is a necessary condition for the successful development of a blue and circular economy,\" the ministry's statement said.\n\nThe ministry said the strategy aimed to resolve \"past issues,\" and it should not be interpreted that they ended the dialogue with T\u00fcrkiye on the issue. The ministry, however, underlined that any discussion should not be considered a concession to T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n\"Greece desires a positive climate in relations with T\u00fcrkiye and favors a relationship based on international law and good neighborliness,\" the statement said.\n\nEarlier this week, the Ankara University National Research Center for Maritime Law (DEHUKAM) published the first academic study on T\u00fcrkiye's MSP, which aims for the country to maximize sustainable use of its surrounding seas. T\u00fcrkiye's marine spatial planning efforts, launched years ago to protect its rights and interests in surrounding seas, better assess the environmental impacts of future maritime activities, and maximize the use of marine areas, are now reaching their final stage with contributions from relevant institutions. As part of this initiative, DEHUKAM published a map on the website www.dmpturkiye.dehukam.org.\n\nThe map shows that under T\u00fcrkiye's marine spatial planning, areas beyond its territorial waters in surrounding seas have been designated for economic, scientific and military activities, with specific zones identified for each purpose. The studies are being conducted both to safeguard T\u00fcrkiye's rights and interests in its seas and to ensure alignment with the EU's relevant legislation.\n\nAccording to official sources, a high-level \"Inter-Institutional Coordination Committee\" will be established under the auspices of the presidency and coordinated by the Foreign Ministry to manage Ankara's MSP across state institutions. The plan, which functions as a \"master plan\" for the seas, will help guide how maritime areas will be used.\n\nThe Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) is also reportedly conducting similar studies toward declaring its own MSP. The MSP study is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the \"Blue Homeland\" concept among the public and relevant sectors and to help organize T\u00fcrkiye's activities in the surrounding seas in a more structured way by also taking environmental factors into account.\n\nAccording to a DEHUKAM statement, seas are not only a source of natural wealth but are also essential for economic development, food security and ecosystem health. Effective, sustainable and multi-stakeholder governance of the seas is therefore critical, and this is where MSPs come into play. An MSP is a science-based, participatory and integrated planning process developed to ensure harmonious use of coastal and marine areas. It aims to balance different uses such as fisheries, energy production, transportation, tourism, conservation and scientific research for optimal and sustainable utilization of marine spaces. An MSP is a tool for protecting marine areas and evaluating economic potential, but also contributes to strengthening the blue economy, managing marine protected areas, combating climate change and securing the future of the seas.\n\nAlthough T\u00fcrkiye has not yet officially adopted an MSP, significant progress has been made in recent years. Numerous studies, research efforts and projects related to an MSP have been conducted in collaboration with public institutions, universities, civil society organizations and the private sector.\n\nThe academic interest in an MSP is also growing, with the topic being widely discussed at national and international conferences, symposiums and workshops. As part of these efforts, DEHUKAM has led the establishment of the T\u00fcrkiye MSP Platform, which aims to present the country's efforts in this field within a structured framework. The platform includes up-to-date information on MSP-related projects in T\u00fcrkiye, the authorities responsible, current legislative infrastructure, and the core elements of an MSP.\n\nOne of the most striking components of the T\u00fcrkiye MSP Platform is the new map, created using open data sources shared by public institutions and the private sector. The MSP map visually presents marine activities, potential areas of use and planning needs in Turkish waters. It serves as a critical reference for decision-makers, researchers and investors. The development of such a map marks a concrete and strategic step in T\u00fcrkiye's marine spatial planning process. The map, created as an academic study, does not represent the official position of T\u00fcrkiye. The designated areas on the DEHUKAM map indicate project implementation zones and do not imply state jurisdiction. Still, the T\u00fcrkiye MSP Platform functions not only as an information-sharing tool but also as a strategic platform that strengthens multi-stakeholder collaboration, bridges academia and practice and supports policymaking. All of these efforts reflect T\u00fcrkiye's determination to scientifically build its \"Blue Homeland\" vision, recognizing the economic potential, environmental value and geopolitical importance of the seas surrounding the country.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye aims to develop a holistic and sustainable management model for its marine areas, ensuring the conservation and development of the \"Blue Homeland\" for both current and future generations.\n\nDEHUKAM CEO Mustafa Ba\u015fkara spoke to Anadolu Agency (AA) about the first academic study on T\u00fcrkiye's MSP, highlighting the growing global need for marine resources.\n\nHowever, Ba\u015fkara warned that increased marine use has threatened the sustainability of seas, marine ecosystems and biodiversity. \"That's why marine spatial planning studies were initiated by UNESCO with the initiatives of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission in the 2000s,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that while the EU made MSPs mandatory for member states with a 2014 directive, T\u00fcrkiye, as a non-member, has chosen to carry out an MSP entirely within the framework of its own sovereignty.\n\nHe emphasized that the research and activities led by DEHUKAM are based on an ecosystem-based approach and that the T\u00fcrkiye MSP Platform covers studies, projects and institutional findings related to marine spatial planning.\n\nBa\u015fkara underscored that the MSP map is not a one-time, finalized product, but a \"living map\" \u2013 one that can evolve and be refined in line with developing needs and newly identified jurisdictions. He stated that T\u00fcrkiye's marine needs \u2013 such as for energy, fisheries and transportation \u2013 will reach new dimensions through the use of the MSP map and integration with the blue economy.\n\n\"Our work in this field is based on academic scientific data and produced using publicly available resources, in coordination with public institutions,\" he said.",

      "title": "This Agency Fights Corruption. New York City Leaders Have Weakened It.",
      "text": "In recent months, New York City\u2019s government has been rocked by corruption scandals at a pace not seen in nearly a century.\n\nYet over the past few years, New York\u2019s leaders have presided over a gradual weakening of the city\u2019s No. 1 corruption-fighting agency, the Department of Investigation, records and interviews show.\n\nAs caseloads have risen, they have stood by while dozens of positions within the department have gone unfilled, allowing the agency to lose more than a quarter of its employees over the past six years.\n\nAnd they have funded the department unevenly, allocating fewer dollars for salaries for investigators, auditors and other personnel in the department\u2019s current budget than it received during a high-water mark in 2019.\n\nIn recent months, the agency has been so strapped for funds that it has tapped millions of dollars forfeited by people convicted of crimes to cover basic operating costs.\n\nThis has occurred not because the department has failed to ask for more funding. Last fall, its commissioner, Jocelyn Strauber, sought permission from the city\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to hire 23 staff members at a cost of $1.4 million.\n\nThe City Council supported the request, but the budget office rejected it. Soon after, Gale Brewer, the chairwoman of the Council\u2019s Oversight and Investigations Committee, said in a letter to city budget leaders that because of staffing issues the department had experienced significant disruptions whenever employees went on vacation. In January, the budget office said it would pay for 10 additional hires.\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Strauber said that the department\u2019s \u201cstaffing challenges\u201d had led to delays in issuing reports and sometimes caused investigators and other workers to juggle complex inquiries.\n\n\u201cOver the last three years, we have asked them to take on more work and more responsibility, often for no additional compensation,\u201d she said, \u201cand every time they have stepped up and have served the city admirably under very challenging conditions.\u201d\n\nThe pressures on the department have only increased under the administration of Mayor Eric Adams. Hiring constraints implemented by Mr. Adams have made it more difficult for the agency to add staffing. And corruption inquiries involving the mayor and members of his administration have contributed heavily to the increased workload.\n\nLast year, Mr. Adams became the first sitting mayor in the city\u2019s modern history to be indicted on federal corruption charges. His chief adviser was also charged in state court with taking part in a separate bribery scheme. And a close aide was charged with witness tampering and destroying evidence in the investigation into the mayor.\n\nA dozen other aides \u2014 including Mr. Adams\u2019s schools chancellor, first deputy mayor, deputy mayor for public safety and two successive police commissioners \u2014 have resigned after having their devices seized or homes searched in state or federal corruption inquiries.\n\nThe Department of Investigation worked with the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors to build the case against the mayor, and it has played an important role in the other inquiries.\n\nBut after Mr. Adams assiduously courted the Trump administration, the president\u2019s Justice Department took the extraordinary step of asking the judge in the mayor\u2019s case to dismiss the charges.\n\nOn Wednesday, the judge, Dale E. Ho, granted the request, capping a saga that had seen federal prosecutors clash bitterly with Justice Department officials. Some of the prosecutors resigned in protest over what they described as a corrupt deal to secure Mr. Adams\u2019s cooperation with President Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nThe situation has focused renewed attention on the Department of Investigation, which is also empowered to build cases against public officials in state courts. (There has been no indication that New York prosecutors might seek to file state charges against Mr. Adams.)\n\nThe move to drop the Adams case has also led to calls by some New York officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, to insulate the department from potential interference by the mayor and other city officials.\n\nUnder its current structure, the department\u2019s commissioner serves at the pleasure of the mayor, and at times that has created a complicated dynamic.\n\nMayor Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s commissioner was a close friend whose agency regularly briefed Mr. Giuliani on investigations and sometimes investigated news leaks and sought political intelligence.\n\nUnder Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Rose Gill Hearn became the city\u2019s longest serving investigation commissioner, with a reputation for focusing on low- and midlevel city employees and contractors.\n\nAnd during the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, two successive commissioners oversaw an agency that issued a series of reports criticizing the mayor himself, including for his use of a security detail for trips during his failed presidential campaign and to move his daughter to Gracie Mansion.\n\nAfter clashing with his first commissioner, Mark G. Peters, Mr. de Blasio fired him, citing a report by an independent investigator that said Mr. Peters had abused his power and mistreated subordinates. Mr. Peters disputed the findings and said the mayor had forced him out to stop him from completing inquiries that might have reflected poorly on Mr. de Blasio \u2014 a claim the former mayor has denied.\n\n\u201cGovernment integrity is absolutely dependent on a robust inspector general system,\u201d Mr. Peters said in an interview, \u201cand you can\u2019t have that system without sufficient staffing.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Mayor Adams, Liz Garcia, said that the department\u2019s budget was higher today than it was when he took office.\n\n\u201cThe Adams administration remains committed to supporting the important work that the New York City Department of Investigation does to ensure accountability and transparency in government,\u201d Ms. Garcia said.\n\nThe administration has worked with the department to address retention issues and adjust the pay scale for investigators.\n\nAfter Mr. Adams became mayor, he selected Ms. Strauber \u2014 a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York \u2014 to burnish his public safety and anti-corruption credentials, according to a person familiar with his thinking at the time.\n\nLess than three years later, she stood beside Damian Williams, then the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, as the charges against Mr. Adams were announced \u2014 a move that was seen by some in his orbit as a personal slight, the person said.\n\nIn February, Ms. Hochul proposed changes to the law that would bar the mayor from firing the investigation commissioner without the approval of the state inspector general.\n\nStretched Thin\n\nThe Department of Investigation, formerly known as the Office of the Commissioner of Accounts, is one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the United States. It was created in 1873 after the fall of the Tammany Hall boss William M. Tweed, who had mastered the art of enriching himself with city funds.\n\nOver the years, the agency has regularly rooted out corruption schemes, fraud and abuse in the Police Department, city jails and other agencies.\n\nUnder Mayor de Blasio, the agency had a staff of more than 550 investigators, lawyers, auditors and other employees. It issued a series of hard-nosed reports that exposed failures of the city\u2019s Housing Authority and a highly critical report on the Police Department\u2019s sex crimes unit.\n\nIn the 2017 fiscal year alone, the agency made over 800 arrests \u2014 the highest in nearly a decade.\n\nThen Mr. Adams became mayor. His administration instituted a hiring freeze, citing the rising costs of the migrant crisis, slowing tax revenues and the ending of federal pandemic aid. When the freeze was lifted, he imposed restrictions on hiring across all city departments, requiring two employees to leave their jobs for every one hired into a vacant position.\n\nThe budget constraints affected hiring citywide, and agencies have also struggled to recruit and retain employees since the coronavirus pandemic upended life in New York. But the restrictions have hit the Department of Investigation especially hard, records and interviews show.\n\nIn the most recent fiscal year, the department received nearly as many corruption complaints \u2014 14,600 \u2014 as it got when its staffing was at a high point under Mr. de Blasio.\n\nFewer cases have been referred for criminal prosecution or civil and administrative action. Arrests are down, too, by 58 percent from 2017, according to management reports filed by the mayor\u2019s office. Department officials say that is not necessarily a reflection of staffing shortages.\n\nThe department has also been hampered in its hiring because it offers lower pay compared with what investigators and lawyers might make in the private sector \u2014 or even at other public agencies.\n\n\u201cIt was common for us to lose talented young investigators,\u201d said Margaret M. Garnett, who served as the department\u2019s commissioner for the last three years of the de Blasio administration. \u201cThey can go to the frauds department at American Express and triple their salary. It is hard to tell someone making $60,000 a year at 27 that they shouldn\u2019t take a job paying them $150,000 a year.\u201d\n\nNow the department has about 70 administrative and operations employees and more than 330 investigators spread across 10 squads.\n\nMore than half of the investigators are on loan from other agencies, such as the Department of Correction or the Housing Authority. It is a staffing practice that has allowed the office to take on more cases and employ investigators with firsthand knowledge of the institutions they are investigating.\n\nAt times, however, the arrangement has presented problems. In 2023, The New York Times found that at least two investigators on loan from the Correction Department had been tasked with rooting out sick-leave fraud while abusing sick-leave policies themselves.\n\nLimited room for upward mobility has also made hiring and retaining qualified people a challenge, current and former officials have said.\n\nWhen Ms. Garnett led the office under the de Blasio administration, she wanted to address the agency\u2019s staffing issues in part by hiring retired city police detectives, she said.\n\nBut state laws restrict such practices, in order to keep city employees from drawing a pension while also earning a city salary. Agencies who want to hire city retirees have to obtain a waiver from the Civil Service Commission, and even then there are constraints on how much the retired employee can earn.\n\nThe waivers are approved for two years at a time and granted only to fill vacancies temporarily and under certain conditions.\n\nMs. Garnett said the Department of Investigation would likely benefit from bringing on retired detectives with practical experience investigating crimes to fill some of the agency\u2019s positions.\n\nInstead, she said, it has often been forced to bring on candidates with no experience at all.",

      "title": "Tulip Siddiq hit with arrest warrant on corruption charges",
      "text": "An arrest warrant has been issued for Tulip Siddiq over allegations she illegally received a plot of land from her despot aunt\u2019s government.\n\nSheikh Hasina, Ms Siddiq\u2019s aunt, and several others face possible detention after charges filed by Bangladesh\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).\n\nThe ACC believe the former City minister received a 7,200 sq ft plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital Dhaka through \u201cabuse of power and influence\u201d.\n\nIt is part of a wider investigation into the alleged unlawful allocation of state-owned land to Ms Hasina, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh, her children and close relatives.\n\nThe case is separate from a \u00a34 billion embezzlement investigation by the ACC into a nuclear deal struck by Ms Hasina, in which Ms Siddiq had also been named.\n\nMs Siddiq, who resigned from the UK Government in January amid scrutiny of her links to Ms Hasina, has been named in three Bangladeshi inquiries. She has denied the charges and accused the Bangladeshi government of a \u201ctargeted and baseless\u201d campaign against her and asked why it had briefed the media but not put its allegations to her directly.\n\nIt is understood that Ms Siddiq has not heard directly from the Bangladeshi authorities and that she first became aware of the warrant after it was reported on Sunday.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday afternoon, a spokesman for Ms Siddiq said the allegations made against her were \u201ccompletely false\u201d and \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d.\n\nThe spokesman said: \u201cThe ACC has made various allegations against Ms Siddiq through the media in the last few months. The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Ms Siddiq\u2019s lawyers.\n\n\u201cThe ACC has not responded to Ms Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. Ms Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued.\u201d\n\nThe ACC petitioned the Bangladeshi courts on March 10, asking for a travel ban to be imposed on Ms Hasina, Ms Siddiq and other family members.\n\nThe same court had earlier issued arrest warrants against Ms Hasina, her daughter Saima Wazed and 16 others in another corruption case involving plot allocation. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.\n\nOn Sunday, the Conservatives called on Ms Siddiq to step down as an MP and Sir Keir Starmer to suspend her from Labour.\n\nA Conservative spokesman said: \u201cIf it is the case that Keir Starmer\u2019s choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking that Keir Starmer believes \u2018the door remains open\u2019 for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position.\n\n\u201cKeir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.\u201d\n\nBen Obese-Jecty, the Tory MP for Huntingdon, added: \u201cKeir Starmer has previously suggested that he would welcome her back. How can she return to a government role with persistent questions regarding her conduct?\u201d\n\nIn his response to Ms Siddiq\u2019s resignation letter in January, Sir Keir told her that she had \u201cmade a difficult decision\u201d, before adding: \u201cThe door remains open for you going forward.\u201d\n\nCalum Miller, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said: \u201cThis is obviously a very serious allegation from the Bangladeshi Government.\n\n\u201cThe UK Government should urgently engage with the relevant Bangladeshi authorities to secure more details. Transparency from the Bangladeshi Government and Tulip Siddiq on the allegations and evidence is absolutely vital.\n\n\u201cAfter years of Conservative sleaze and scandal, people rightly expected better from this government. So it\u2019s gravely concerning that the government\u2019s former corruption minister now has new questions to answer in this deepening corruption scandal.\u201d\n\nForged signatures\n\nThe ACC says Ms Siddiq illegally acquired a flat and then used forged signatures in an attempt to transfer it to Azmina Siddiq Ruponti, her sister.\n\nInvestigators claim Ms Siddiq made the transfer to become eligible for a plot in the Purbachal New Town Project, which she later obtained. Under Bangladesh\u2019s Allotment of Land Rules, applicants for the scheme must not own any residential property or land in Dhaka.\n\nInvestigators also allege that she hid the property from her income tax records from 2015 onwards.\n\nSeeking to have the flat seized, the ACC argued that members of Ms Hasina\u2019s family, including Ms Siddiq, were attempting to transfer or conceal their assets.\n\nMs Siddiq\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cTo be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means.\n\n\u201cShe has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh, and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else. No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Ms Siddiq, and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated.\u201d\n\nThe arrest warrant places renewed focus on the absence of an extradition treaty between Bangladesh and the UK.\n\nBangladeshi authorities were pressing Britain to formalise an agreement. In 2023, Anisul Huq, the then Bangladeshi law minister, confirmed that discussions had been held with the British High Commissioner.\n\nDhaka seeks the return of several high-profile fugitives, including army officers implicated in the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. However, talks stalled after Ms Hasina\u2019s government was toppled in a civilian uprising.",

      "title": "\u2018This Has To End\u2019: Revelations Renew Calls For Government Accountability",
      "text": "House and Senate leadership have little to say about the subject of a federal bribery investigation giving one of their 2022 colleagues $35,000.\n\nA growing chorus of good government advocates want the Legislature to increase accountability within its own ranks following a Civil Beat story about an unknown Hawai\u02bbi lawmaker receiving a $35,000 donation amid an ongoing federal corruption investigation.\n\nAt minimum, they want lawmakers to reduce the influence of special interests by publicly financing campaigns and banning donations from government contractors and their families. Both of those measures are under consideration this session, which is scheduled to end May 2.\n\n\u201cThey need to take a firmer stance and just say: Absolutely not. This has to end,\u201d said Aria Juliet Castillo, who directs a pro-democracy program at the Hawai\u02bbi Alliance for Progressive Action.\n\nCurrent and former lawmakers and others say the Legislature suffers from a perception of corruption that was underscored in the Civil Beat story, which revealed previously unknown details from a federal investigation. Federal prosecutors say that in January 2022, an unnamed man allegedly paid former Rep. Ty Cullen $3,000 hoping for help with an \u201cofficial request\u201d, and that the man later paid $35,000 to another \u201cinfluential\u201d lawmaker for an \u201cexisting campaign.\u201d\n\nOne or both of those transactions was likely illegal, experts say, but three years later, neither has resulted in criminal charges.\n\nInvestigation: FBI Recorded Hawai\u02bbi Lawmaker Being Given $35,000\n\nThe handoffs were part of a federal investigation that resulted in Cullen and former Senate Majority Leader J. Kalani English pleading guilty to bribery and serving prison time.\n\nHouse Speaker Nadine Nakamura declined to be interviewed by Civil Beat. In a written statement, she broadly defended current lawmakers and said that the criminal justice system so far \u201cdid what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d Senate President Ron Kouchi didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Plan?\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since Cullen recorded his interaction with the unnamed man and the \u201cinfluential\u201d lawmaker for the FBI. Yet, no charges have been announced.\n\nCamron Hurt, state director for the government accountability nonprofit Common Cause Hawai\u02bbi, said state law enforcement officials should investigate the $35,000 handoff. With President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice allegedly cutting staff that focuses on public corruption, he said Hawai\u02bbi can\u2019t afford to wait for the federal government.\n\n\u201cHawai\u02bbi being reactive to corruption is how we\u2019ve become one of the seemingly most corrupt supermajority states in the union,\u201d Hurt said of the Legislature, where Democrats have held most of the seats for decades. \u201cAnd that should be an embarrassment to all, and it should be a call to action to fix this.\u201d\n\nState ethics commission Executive Director Robert Harris has already taken an interest in the case of the lawmaker who accepted the $35,000, which would violate the law if the lawmaker did not report it as income or as a gift.\n\nThe state Campaign Spending Commission, which oversees political donations, may also get involved because there is no indication the $35,000 was reported as campaign donations.\n\nTony Baldomero, the commission\u2019s associate director, said he would need to know the legislator\u2019s name to look at their campaign finance reports.\n\n\u201cWe would do an investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was not reported, there\u2019s consequences for that.\u201d\n\nHurt called on legislative leaders to tell the public how they will regain the public\u2019s trust.\n\n\u201cDemocrats in the state of Hawai\u02bbi have a serious corruption perception problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are we supposed to trust this Legislature if we don\u2019t know if someone who participated in bribery is still there?\u201d\n\nKey Corrective Measures Stalled\n\nThree years ago, following a series of corruption scandals, including the one involving Cullen and English, the House convened a panel chaired by retired Judge Dan Foley. The commission\u2019s final report made a series of recommendations to address what it called the \u201cdeep moral crisis\u201d at the Legislature.\n\nLawmakers passed several recommendations, including restricting campaigns from accepting more than $100 in cash from any single donor, boosting transparency around political fundraisers, increasing ethics training and banning campaign finance violators from public office for 10 years.\n\nHowever, legislators left many other reforms on the cutting room floor in 2023 and failed to pass them the following year. Lawmakers still have time to take action on some of these proposals during this year\u2019s session.\n\nThe Hawai\u02bbi Alliance for Progressive Action and other reform advocates are pushing for passage of House Bill 370, which would expand public financing in elections, and House Bill 371, which prohibits government contractors and their immediate family members from donating to candidates.\n\nFoley said that at a minimum, lawmakers should pass both this session.\n\nBut he thinks lawmakers should eventually ban all campaign contributions during the legislative session so legislators aren\u2019t taking money from people or organizations that are lobbying for their votes. A bill that would have done that was passed by the House this session but died after it failed to get a hearing in the Senate.\n\nHe also wants the Legislature to ban candidates from using campaign money to donate to other campaigns, which has allowed powerful lawmakers with large war chests to build coalitions and maintain control over members.\n\nPassing measures that have failed to gain traction could help increase transparency and accountability in government, Foley said.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m a glass-half-full guy, but I think the public demands it,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer state Sen. Russell Ruderman agreed with Foley, but said he would add other reforms, including term limits and comprehensive public funding of political campaigns. Those measures, versions of which Ruderman supported as a senator, could \u201cbring about reform of a fundamentally corrupt system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people with the most power retain the most power and the public doesn\u2019t have a chance at seeing any real reform,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Kim Coco Iwamoto, a progressive Democrat who unseated former House Speaker Scott Saiki last year, said the state\u2019s political leadership is not listening to the people.\n\n\u201cI think the message is the Legislature doesn\u2019t care if the public trusts them or not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe onus is on the Legislature to show, and demonstrate, that we are worthy of trust, and we are listening, and we are changing the laws.\u201d\n\nNumerous government reform measures have been ignored, she said. Committee chairs continue to hold unilateral power to kill bills, and powerful politicians are still allowed to spread their campaign money around to their allies, who reciprocate by supporting their friends\u2019 bids for leadership positions. Measures to curb these two practices have not advanced.\n\nPerhaps the most effective way to force a politician to listen, she said, is to vote them out of office.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only recourse,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Unsubstantiated Allegations\u2019\n\nNakamura, the House speaker, has said little about the revelation of the $35,000 transaction that occurred at the start of the 2022 session.\n\nShe instead pointed in her statement back to the \u201cdark cloud\u201d that Cullen and English cast over the Legislature after they were caught accepting bribes.\n\n\u201cFortunately, our legal system did what it\u2019s supposed to do: investigate, press charges, convict, and send two guilty individuals to prison,\u201d Nakamura said, calling on federal prosecutors to continue pursuing evidence.\n\n\u201cHowever, it saddens me that the law-abiding men and women of the Hawai\u02bbi State Legislature, who are truly serving their communities, and are working on impactful legislation to benefit residents throughout our State are subjected to unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations of \u2018rampant corruption\u2019,\u201d she said in her statement.\n\nThat Kouchi, the top leader in the Senate, did not respond to multiple phone and email messages from Civil Beat this week is the kind of silence that is deafening, according to government reform advocates.\n\n\u201cThey always want to just go back to business as usual because that is easiest for them,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nSen. Brenton Awa, one of only three Republicans in the Senate, said lawmakers should hold themselves to a higher moral standard. To those who fail to do so, he said, shame on them.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s in their lifetime or not, they\u2019ll be found out, and they\u2019ll be judged,\u201d he said. \u201cI know today it might feel good taking something for yourself, but when your life is over and your kids and grandkids have to live with your name \u2014 I hope they think about that.\u201d",

      "title": "Eric Adams Isn\u2019t Corrupt?",
      "text": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nAfter all the public groveling and taxpayer-funded trips to Mar-a-Lago, New York City Mayor Eric Adams appears to have successfully prostrated himself to freedom. A federal judge on Wednesday permanently dismissed the wide-ranging corruption charges brought against him.\n\n\u201cWe can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\u201d Adams said shortly after the dismissal was announced, holding a copy of FBI director Kash Patel\u2019s Government Gangsters. \u201cI\u2019m going to encourage every New Yorker to read it,\u201d he added, referring to the conspiracy-addled book.\n\nThe remarks, though brief, succinctly captured the presence of a public figure historically incapable of remorse, something of a feat in an era of Trumpian shamelessness. Because one would think that the recipient of such enormous good luck\u2014I mean, what else can we call this outcome?\u2014against the backdrop of egregious levels of government corruption, would force some modesty out of a person even as brazen as Adams. But as the allegations against Adams fully demonstrated, acting in ill-advised ways is simply how he operates.\n\nAs my colleague Anna Merlan wrote, the alleged crimes that got him in trouble with the feds in the first place, which ranged from bribery to wire fraud, were grim. But they were also unquestionably comical, carried out with the clowning of a bad slapstick comedy. There was the alleged insistence on putting everything in writing; accepting piles of cash with zero regard for discretion; requiring Turkish Air for travel (the first stop is always Istanbul).\n\nAt first blush, the scandal seemed to instantly decimate Adams\u2019 political future. His favorability among New York City residents plummeted and potential jail time was a genuine possibility. But two months after the charges were unsealed, Adams received the ultimate good fortune in President Donald Trump\u2019s victory, kicking off months of ingratiating behavior by Adams. This extended into policy: the selling out of New York City\u2019s long-held status as a sanctuary city and greenlighting Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s return to Rikers. Adams also refused to condemn the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia student who was detained last month over his pro-Palestinian views despite holding a green card.\n\nAll the fawning has now landed Adams not just one, but two clear victories: the end of the federal investigation into his alleged corruption, and, perhaps more importantly, protection from the administration should it seek to refile.\n\nIn other words, Adams got away with it\u2014handsomely. But in promoting the book of a conspiratorial MAGA head on Wednesday, Adams appeared to signal that he remained willing to go out of his way to boost MAGA\u2019s agenda, even if now technically scot-free.",

      "text": "BRUSSELS \u2014 Three Huawei employees and a managing director from Brussels conference organizer Forum Europe were represented in court this week for hearings related to the corruption investigation into the Chinese tech giant's lobbying in Europe.\n\nPolice raided more than 20 locations in Belgium and Portugal last month within an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by Huawei to secure an open letter signed by eight European lawmakers in support of the company\u2019s interests, according to the Belgian prosecutor and an arrest warrant seen by POLITICO. Five people were charged as part of the investigation, prosecutors said on March 18.\n\nIn the first session, the parties met for a 15 minutes behind closed doors at Brussels' Chamber of Accusation, an appeals court where defense teams discuss ongoing investigations with senior Belgian judges regarding procedural decisions such as whether individuals should be released from custody. A second session, on Wednesday, lasted for more than two hours.\n\nAccording to a court timetable available on site at the Brussels Palace of Justice, the suspects include a lobbyist from Huawei as well as a senior executive and a procurement manager of the Chinese tech firm. The higher profile Huawei employees can be named as Han W. and Valerio O.\n\nAll are suspected of corruption, participation in a criminal organization and money laundering. They are presumed innocent.\n\nTwo other defendants are contractors, including one from UK-based Forum Europe who is charged with \"active corruption of a person holding a public office in an organization governed by public international law,\" according to the timetable.\n\nForum Europe said in an email: \"We do not have any comment at this time.\"\n\nThe arrest warrant, which POLITICO reported on last week, included details from Belgian prosecutors alleging the key suspects may have facilitated the payments for the pro-Huawei letter. \"A sum of \u20ac15,000 was offered to the writer of the 5G letter, while each co-signatory was offered \u20ac1,500,\" read the warrant, signed by the investigative judge.\n\n\u201cThis transaction or proposed transaction is said to have been endorsed by HUAWEI's Chinese executives, in particular by .... [the] director of the Brussels office,\u201d it also said.\n\nThe warrant also described how the former adviser allegedly arranged for the payments via invoices that investigators suspect might be for \"alleged consultancy services and campaign expenses, in the amounts of \u20ac18,450 and \u20ac27,500.\"\n\nHuawei said in an earlier statement that it \u201ctakes these allegations seriously\u201d and \u201chas a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Belgium told POLITICO in a statement that \"the Chinese side is in communication with relevant authorities of the Belgian government\" and that the \"Chinese government always requires Chinese companies [to] strictly observe laws and regulations of the host countries.\"\n\nTwo other people \u2014 one former and one current parliamentary assistant to conservative Italian lawmaker Fulvio Martusciello \u2014 were arrested in France and Italy as part of the probe, bringing the total number of suspects to at least seven. They both denied any involvement and accepted being extradited.",

      "title": "The usual suspect: Corruption",
      "text": "There was not even any earthquake event when the Cabagan-Santa Maria bridge in Isabela collapsed and injured six motorists on the evening of Feb. 27. An alleged overloaded truck was identified as the culprit for causing the newly built suspension bridge to collapse. Incident report has it that a truck weighing 102 tons caused a portion of the bridge to collapse.\n\nBased on the subsequent investigation, President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. (PBBM) attributed the collapse to the supposed \u201cunder design\u201d of the suspension bridge. But this was before he personally inspected the bridge along with Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Manuel Bonoan last March 6.\n\nKnown as the no-talk, no-mistake DPWH secretary, he apparently succeeded in convincing PBBM that the contractor could not be faulted. After all, the contractor merely followed the original plan. But DPWH found out that specifications became flawed to conform to the lower budget allocated for the project. \u201cWho\u2019s responsible is basically who made the design. Look what happened,\u201d PBBM rhetorically asked and replied to his own question.\n\nAlbert Ca\u00f1ete, the chief engineer of the firm behind the design of the collapsed bridge, urged statements should be based on the results of a \u201cforensic engineering investigation.\u201d Offhand, he insisted the design complied with the specifications set by the DPWH. As designed, it can withstand up to 54 tons, or the equivalent of two trucks weighing 27 tons each.\n\nGiven the reputation of the DPWH as among the most-graft prone government agencies, we cannot help but see the bridge collapse as the consequence of whatever corruption went into that project through the years of its construction.\n\nWe cannot really blame contractors because they are also victims of corruption in government. In his homily about \u201cTransfiguration\u201d on the second Sunday of Lent, our parish priest shared what he described as \u201cMarites\u201d or slang for loose talks. He told us about having listened to a self-confession of an un-named government official. \u201cAs they say, straight from the horse\u2019s mouth,\u201d our priest quipped.\n\nParaphrasing him, it was about how contractors include in their costing an item called \u201cfor the boys\u201d in any government projects. As an example, our priest quoted the government official: for a project worth P100 million, contractors set aside P25 million, or about 25 percent of the total cost of any government funded project.\n\nOn the other hand, we also have heard complaints of contractors from Southern Philippines of alleged harassment and intimidation by an official from the Office of the Presidential Assistant for Eastern Mindanao (OPAMinE). The official allegedly has been asking for advances and in return, the contractors are guaranteed to be awarded multimillion pesos worth of government infrastructure projects. This errant official would always claim: \u201cUtos lang ito ng mga Boss.\u201d But he never delivers.\n\nAnd the same official reportedly pins the blame to Special Assistant to the President (SAP) Anton Lagdameo and PBBM. Since he got appointed in 2023, this official has purportedly been using his Mindanaoan roots and position to entice contractors and businessmen to invest in his narrative even without authority from DPWH and SAP Lagdameo.\n\nHe also allegedly goes to Malaca\u00f1ang to get information about possible judiciary appointments in Mindanao. Once he gets a copy of the shortlist of nominees, he will meet these personalities and guarantee they will get the desired court assignment if they cough up grease money. The sad part is his audacity to carry out his corruption the name of the President and SAP Lagdameo.\n\nWith his mighty position in Mindanao, he may have amassed already so much personal wealth from peddling non-existent projects and court appointments. A lifestyle check and an investigation into his dubious and deceitful activities should end such pests in public service.\n\nIn a radio interview earlier, Ombudsman Samuel Martires was quoted as pointing to the National Food Authority (NFA) as the most corrupt government agency. The NFA is a government-run corporation under the Department of Agriculture (DA). In particular, Martires noted with dismay the ombudsman investigators found out why the NFA is seemingly weak in its mandate of stabilizing the prices of rice and other basic food supplies in the markets amid multimillion-peso worth of imported rice and other agricultural products to meet the demand.\n\nMartires subsequently clarified that his statement had been taken out of context in that radio interview. However, Martires was extensively quoted about the ombudsman\u2019s observations. \u201cWhen we investigated, we found corruption,\u201d the ombudsman declared without equivocation.\n\n\u201cWe asked why this is happening, they said it was because the agricultural inspectors say: \u2018It\u2019s OK.\u2019 And all Customs has to do is collect the tax,\u201d Martires said in that radio interview.\n\nThe Bureau of Customs is another story of corruption. As a young reporter then, Customs, along with the Bureau of Internal Revenue \u2013 both under the Department of Finance \u2013 were notoriously tagged among the most corrupt government agencies. And definitely, the same sentiments prevail up to the present.\n\nNo less than the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights attested to this on its \u201cConcluding Observations\u201d on the Philippines\u2019 implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and efforts to fight corruption rendered on Feb. 18 in Geneva, Switzerland. In its report on the Philippines, it stated: \u201c\u2026the Committee remains concerned that corruption remains pervasive in all branches of government, and in the wider public sector.\u201d\n\nThe same UN body also expressed its concern about reports on anti-corruption bodies, such as the Office of the Ombudsman and the Commission on Audit. COA lacks sufficient financial and technical resources to effectively investigate all reported government transactions tainted with graft and corruption.\n\nWithout benefit of investigation, the immediate reaction always leads us to suspect corruption as the culprit.\n\nHave we become so jaded to so much corruption in our government agencies? Thus, it is not surprising to blame everything that goes bad as largely due to corruption.",

      "title": "Judge dismisses corruption case against Mayor Eric Adams",
      "text": "A federal judge has thrown out the corruption indictment against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, ending the first criminal case against a sitting city mayor in modern history.\n\nWhile Judge Dale Ho\u2019s ruling bars the Justice Department from refiling the charges, he sharply criticized the government\u2019s motives for dropping the case, suggesting a political quid pro quo.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the criminal corruption case against Mayor Eric Adams, ruling that it be thrown out \"with prejudice,\" meaning the charges cannot be refiled. The Justice Department had requested the case be dismissed \"without prejudice,\" which would have left open the possibility of refiling the indictment after the election.\n\nJudge Dale Ho declined that request and criticized the department\u2019s rationale, citing concern that it appeared to link the dismissal to the mayor\u2019s cooperation on immigration policy.\n\n\"Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,\" Ho wrote in the ruling.\n\nThis comes after a former U.S. solicitor general advised Judge Ho to accept a Justice Department request to drop corruption charges against Adams.\n\nAfterward, in a short five-minute appearance, Adams apologized to New Yorkers for having to endure what he described as \"a baseless case.\"\n\n\"I never stopped working for you,\" Adams said Wednesday.\n\nHe held up a book by FBI Director Kash Patel, \"Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy,\" and encouraged New Yorkers to read it.\n\nThe book infamously names dozens of political leaders as part of the \"Executive Branch Deep State,\" which critics call an enemies list, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and President Joe Biden.\n\nAdams said Patel's book explained the rationale behind the criminal case against him. \"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\" he said.\n\nWhat does \u2018with prejudice\u2019 mean?\n\nHo\u2019s order to dismiss the case \"with prejudice\" spares Adams from having to govern in a way that pleases Trump, or potentially risk having the Republican\u2019s Justice Department revive the charges.\n\nIn a statement, Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro, said: \"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place\u2014and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed.\"\n\nThe backstory:\n\nAdams had pleaded not guilty to bribery and other charges after a 2024 indictment accused him of accepting illegal campaign contributions and travel discounts from a Turkish official and others.\n\nAdams pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. He claimed the case was politically motivated retaliation for his criticisms of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies. The case was set for trial in April before the Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department moved to dismiss it.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s explanation for the dismissal was that the prosecution interfered with Adams\u2019 ability to support the administration\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nReverse Timeline: The Eric Adams corruption case\n\nTimeline:\n\nHere's a look at how the corruption case unfolded and how the federal government had pushed to dismiss the case:\n\nTuesday, June 24: New York City\u2019s primary election day\n\nMonday, April 21: Adams\u2019 trial was scheduled to start.\n\nTuesday, March 11: Federal judge Dale E. Ho, who was tasked with deciding whether to dismiss corruption charges against Adams, canceled a scheduled hearing. He said he had reviewed filings from the parties and a court-appointed legal expert, all of whom favor dismissal, and \"does not at this time believe that oral argument is necessary.\"\n\nFriday, March 7: Paul Clement, a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush, advised Ho to accept a Justice Department request to drop corruption charges against Adams. Clement said Ho should prevent prosecutors from ever reviving the case so it doesn't hang over Adams \"like the proverbial Sword of Damocles.\"\n\nWednesday, Feb. 19: Adams faced federal judge Ho, who adjourned the corruption trial and appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop charges against the mayor.\n\nTuesday, Feb. 18: New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she was weighing removing Adams from office following the resignation of four of his deputy mayors.\n\nMonday, Feb. 17: Four of Adams\u2019 top deputies announced their resignations.\n\nFriday, Feb. 14: The Justice Department formally asked a court to drop corruption charges against Adams.\n\nThursday, Feb. 13: Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, and five high-ranking Justice Department officials resigned after she refused an order to drop corruption charges.\n\nWednesday, Feb. 12: U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she would \"look into\" why the corruption charges against Adams had not yet been dropped. That same day, Sassoon laid out her objections to dropping the case in an eight-page letter to the attorney general.\n\nMonday, Feb. 10: The Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors with SDNY to drop corruption charges against Adams and halt the ongoing investigation.\n\nMonday, Jan. 6: Federal prosecutors indicated that the investigation into Adams remained active and that they continued to \"uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.\"\n\nMonday, Dec. 16, 2024: Donald Trump, president-elect at the time, said he\u2019d consider pardoning the indicted mayor during a Mar-a-Lago press conference.\n\nThursday, Sept. 26, 2024: Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment accusing Adams of letting Turkish officials and businesspeople buy his influence with illegal campaign contributions and lavish overseas trips.\n\nWho's who in the Adams corruption case, fallout\n\nEric Adams: New York City\u2019s Democratic mayor, who faces bribery and other charges stemming from a September 2024 indictment\n\nDonald Trump: The Republican U.S. president who has previously expressed solidarity with Adams\n\nKathy Hochul: New York\u2019s Democratic governor, who has the power to remove Adams from office\n\nPam Bondi: U.S. Attorney General, head of the Justice Department working to dismiss the federal case against Adams\n\nEmil Bove: The Acting Deputy Attorney General, the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s second in command, who filed paperwork to dismiss corruption charges against Adams\n\nDanielle Sassoon: The former interim U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who penned a letter to Bondi saying she could not follow a directive to drop the office\u2019s corruption case against Adams.\n\nHagen Scotten: The lead prosecutor on the Adams corruption case who resigned Friday after Justice Department officials ordered the dismissal of charges\n\nMatthew Podolsky: The new acting U.S. attorney for SDNY after Sassoon's departure.

      "text": "Ontario's measles outbreak has become so big that public health officials in New York state have included the province in a travel advisory that urges residents to get vaccinated before visiting.\n\n\"Measles is only a car ride away!\" reads the April 2nd measles travel advisory for all New Yorkers from the New York State Department of Health.\n\n\"Currently, measles outbreaks are happening in parts of the United States and Canada, especially in Ontario, and around the world.\"\n\nThe advisory also lists the following countries as having a high number of measles cases: Yemen, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Ethiopia, Romania, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan and Vietnam.\n\n\"Measles is a highly contagious virus. Around 90 per cent of people who are exposed to a person with measles will become infected if they are not vaccinated. Because measles is so contagious, it easily crosses borders,\" the advisory continues.\n\nThe advisory notes that Canada's outbreak includes more than 600 cases with the majority located in Ontario.\n\nAccording to Public Health Ontario, a total of 655 confirmed and probable measles cases have been reported in Ontario this year as of April 2. Of this total, 560 are confirmed and 95 are probable.\n\nInfectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said most of the province's cases are in southwestern Ontario.\n\n\"The key thing to remind ourselves is that this is largely and almost exclusively in unvaccinated cohorts and currently is predominantly in southwestern Ontario \u2014 but people move, people travel and they can bring the virus with them,\" Bogoch told CBC's Metro Morning on Tuesday.\n\n\"We haven't seen this many cases per year in about a decade and it's only April,\" he said.\n\nOntario's Ministry of Health said in a statement on Tuesday that the provincial government and Dr. Kieran Moore, the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, have been clear in their messaging on measles to residents.\n\n\"Vaccination is the most effective way to limit the spread of measles and protect yourself and your loved ones,\" the ministry said.\n\n\"Children who are fully vaccinated with two doses are nearly 100 per cent protected. Over 96 per cent of cases in Ontario are among individuals who are unvaccinated.\"\n\nThe ministry said it is continuing to work with local public health units to make sure residents are up-to-date on their measles vaccine to limit further spread.\n\n'We want to inform the public': public health director\n\nIn the travel advisory, N.Y. officials urge residents to ensure they are fully vaccinated against measles before travelling to another country or an area in the U.S. where there is an outbreak. It says the best way to protect against measles is to ensure that immunizations are up to date with the mumps-measles-rubella vaccine.\n\nWith spring and summer travel season coming, the advisory says people who are not protected can pick up the disease while travelling and spread it once they get back home.\n\n\"Large measles outbreaks are possible when measles cases reach at-risk populations with low immunization rates against measles,\" the advisory reads.\n\nHannah Busman, Director of Public Health for Franklin County, N.Y., which shared the advisory, said in an interview that the public needs to be aware of measles outbreaks before traveling.\n\n\"We want to inform the public and have them have all the information before spring, summer comes up. Any time there are risks like this, the travel advisory does go out so people are prepared,\" Busman said.\n\n'Measles can be a serious disease,' N.Y. official says\n\nIn an April 2 news release, N.Y. officials say travelers should plan to be fully vaccinated against measles at least two weeks before departure. The department recommends two doses for immunization.\n\n\"Measles is more common in different places and exposure during travel is something we need to consider,\" state health commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in the release.\n\n\"Measles can be a serious disease. It is not just a rash; it can cause pneumonia, hospitalization and even death.\"\n\nThe release says the total number of measles cases in the U.S. in the first three months of 2025 is already greater than the total number in the U.S. in all of 2024.\n\nAs of March 26, 483 measles cases have been reported in the U.S., with the majority in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn the release, N.Y. officials added: \"A deluge of vaccine misinformation in recent years has eroded public trust in vaccines, contributing to a rise in vaccine hesitancy and declining vaccination rates.\n\n\"Additionally, the pandemic may have caused people to fall behind on vaccinations. However, due to the seriousness of measles, the Department encourages everyone to get the MMR vaccine.\"\n\nMeasles symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, small spots with white centres inside the mouth, sore eyes, sensitivity to light and a red blotchy rash.",

      "title": "How U.S. public health cuts could raise risks of infectious diseases",
      "text": "At 6 a.m. on March 25, Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services department, got a devastating email. Millions of dollars in federal grants that the health agency had were suddenly gone.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had just rescinded about $12 billion from thousands of state and local health agencies, including Huang\u2019s.\n\nSome of that money was part of a COVID-19 recovery program that health departments were using to beef up testing for many diseases, including bird flu and measles as well as COVID-19. In Dallas, it was going toward a public health lab to expand such testing. Also on the chopping block: a grant that paid for staff providing childhood vaccines, including the measles vaccine, Huang said March 28 in a news briefing to discuss ongoing Trump administration cuts to public health.\n\nJust days later on April 1, thousands of HHS employees learned their jobs were being eliminated. It was part of an unprecedented reduction in force, including workers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health involved in all aspects of infectious diseases research, prevention and treatment. While those cuts are starting to be challenged, much uncertainty remains.\n\nIn addition to domestic cuts, funding for pandemic preparedness, vaccines and malaria will be targeted, documents the U.S. State Department sent to Congress suggest. This follows the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the World Health Organization and the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which helped distribute lifesaving medications and vaccines around the world.\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to \u201cmake America healthy again.\u201d And Trump administration officials say the moves are needed to make government more efficient. But it\u2019s unclear how the breadth of cuts to programs, public health employees and infrastructure will achieve those goals.\n\nTo the contrary, public health experts warn that the cuts \u2014 ranging from local outreach to global surveillance \u2014 will undermine efforts to keep infectious diseases in check, making Americans more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cFear and silence and sudden closures are causing great inefficiency in public health,\u201d says Matifadza Hlatshwayo Davis, health director for the city of St. Louis. \u201cIf the goal is efficiency, there is nothing efficient about this,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is not a way that I want my taxpayer dollars handled with this level of chaos.\u201d\n\nHere is a closer look at some of the ways these different layers of government public health each play a role in helping to protect individuals and communities from disease \u2014 and how cuts could impact those roles.\n\nStopping diseases from reaching American borders\n\n\u201cWe know that infectious diseases do not respect borders,\u201d says Janeen Madan Keller, deputy director of global health policy at the Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C., and London. \u201cSo it\u2019s really, really important that we have the ability to stop these outbreaks in their tracks, including in places in faraway corners of the world before they reach our borders.\u201d\n\nThe United States spends about $1.5 billion each year on global health security to help prepare for and prevent pandemics, epidemics and disease outbreaks around the world, Madan Keller says. \u201cThis amount really is quite modest when we compare it to the outsized benefits it has on the lives of people who live here in the United States, as well as on the lives of people around the world.\u201d\n\nFor instance, there is an estimated $26 return on investment for every dollar spent on vaccines when weighed against the cost of illnesses prevented, according to a 2020 study in Health Affairs. The return is even greater \u2014 $54 for every dollar spent \u2014 when weighing the value of lives saved by vaccines, researchers calculated.\n\n\u201cAny efforts that undermine work to detect and contain these outbreaks \u2026 could not only roll back many, many years of progress \u2026 but also really put the lives of people here at the United States at risk,\u201d Madan Keller says.\n\nOne program on the chopping block is the global vaccine alliance GAVI. That program, which distributes vaccines to lower-income countries, vaccinated more than 1.1 billion children worldwide and saved nearly 19 million lives from 2000 to 2023, according to the organization\u2019s 2023 progress report.\n\nFor instance, GAVI helped to stop the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a decade ago, and established a stockpile of Ebola vaccines that can be deployed when there is an outbreak, such as one in Uganda this year, says Anita Shet, a pediatrician and infectious diseases researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nEbola outbreaks have popped up multiple times since, \u201cbut not a single case came into the U.S.,\u201d Shet says. \u201cThat\u2019s a classic example of how American health is protected when we have this GAVI work going on outside the country.\u201d\n\nA global network of 700 laboratories monitoring measles and rubella that was funded solely by the United States also faces \u201cimminent shutdown,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news briefing March 17 in Geneva. \u201cThis comes at the worst possible time when measles is making a comeback.\u201d\n\nThat includes in the United States, as well as in Canada and across Europe. Measles was officially eliminated from United States in 2000, but travelers can import the virus, sparking outbreaks among pockets of unvaccinated people. This year, a large outbreak in West Texas has sickened more than 400 people, killed one child and spread to other states and into Mexico. In total, outbreaks and isolated measles cases have been reported in 19 states and in New York City so far this year.\n\nFrom basic research to disease response\n\nOn April 1, HHS employees showed up for work only for many to find out they\u2019d been fired. It\u2019s part of an administration plan to restructure the agency and reduce its workforce by 20,000. While some of those moves may be reversed, and many are likely to be challenged \u2014 the American Public Health Association is among those who have filed lawsuits arguing the cuts are \u201ca reckless and illegal purge\u201d \u2014 for now, it\u2019s left large swathes of the national public health system in chaos.\n\nFor now, the moves have eliminated whole agencies and offices, such as the entire staff of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy. Thanks in part to this office\u2019s leadership, HIV is now a chronic disease for many people rather than a death sentence.\n\n\u201cWe have the tools we need to end the HIV epidemic in the United States,\u201d Anna Person, an HIV infectious diseases physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said April 1 in a news briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. \u201cPresident Trump recognized this during his first term and launched the first ever initiative to end the HIV epidemic in America.\u201d Now, she said, \u201cwe are on a fast track to undoing decades of progress, and each new day seems to endanger our gains against this epidemic.\u201d\n\nHIV-fighting infrastructure was built over four decades, Person said. Its rapid disassembly could mean it will take another 40 years to rebuild.\n\nMany NIH research grants and programs are also slated for termination, singled out by the advisory entity called the Department for Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Those include a vast array of studies on sexually transmitted diseases, COVID-19 and vaccines. The mass cancellations include studies investigating how parainfluenza virus infects cells, development of vaccines and medications that can protect against many different coronaviruses and understanding how rhinovirus-caused colds affect children who have had bone marrow transplants.\n\nAmong the programs axed was a network of antiviral drug discovery centers, known as AViDD. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, there were no drugs to treat coronavirus infections, says Nevan Krogan, a systems biologist and director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. The centers were established to develop antivirals against coronaviruses and six other virus families with potential to spark a pandemic.\n\nKrogan\u2019s team of scientists in 43 laboratories around the world have already identified two potential drugs to target SARS-CoV-2 and two other coronaviruses. One is close to going into clinical trials. And the researchers were gearing up to test the two candidate drugs in combination in mice.\n\nThose projects and work at eight other AViDD centers ended midway through the approved funding cycle. \u201cThey just came and said, \u2018You have to stop everything right now. The grant is terminated, so you know, there\u2019s no more funds to continue the work.\u2019\u201d Krogan says he felt \u201cdevastating shock, disappointed, anxious, like, \u2018What are we going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe and colleagues will look for other ways to push the work forward, he says, but pharmaceutical companies may not be ready to invest in the still early-stage work. \u201cIf we had another year or two, I think we would have gotten to a place where they would have been more digestible for the pharma companies to engage.\u201d\n\nClosing the pandemic preparedness centers won\u2019t just hamper efforts to fight off viruses, Krogan says. \u201cWe\u2019re not just building up infrastructure, doing work that\u2019ll just help the next pandemic, it\u2019s to help all disease,\u201d he says. \u201cStudying one disease helps understanding another disease. It\u2019s all connected.\u201d\n\nBoots on the ground\n\nWhen Huang in Dallas got the email about rescinded federal funds, it was \u201creally abrupt notification with no ability to try to scale down or do anything,\u201d he said. Among other things, it left him and his health department scrambling to figure out how to save the jobs of epidemiologists tasked with disease investigations and contact tracing, especially important in a state with a large measles outbreak.\n\nIn St. Louis, Hlatshwayo Davis worries about a basic nutrition support and education program for young people her health department conducted in partnership with the YMCA. The program\u2019s funds were part of about $4 million lost when the Trump administration rescinded the COVID grants. Abruptly shuttering such programs is \u201ccompletely irresponsible and destructive,\u201d Hlatshwayo Davis says.\n\nThe administration has claimed that the pandemic is over so it is no longer necessary to spend money on COVID.\n\nSuch take-backs are unprecedented, says Dara Lieberman, director of government relations for the Trust for America\u2019s Health, a nonpartisan, nonprofit public health policy and advocacy organization based in Washington D.C. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Congress rescind money that had not been spent yet, that had not been obligated, but I\u2019ve never seen money that was actually out in the field being pulled back.\u201d\n\nAttorneys general and governors from 23 states and Washington, D.C., sued April 1 to restore the funds, arguing that HHS didn\u2019t have the right to pull back money that had already been allocated.\n\nThe abrupt funding cuts and dismantling of public health infrastructure is counterproductive, Hlatshwayo Davis says. She has grown St. Louis\u2019 city health department budget through federal grants, streamlining programs and finding ways to be more efficient, she says. Experts should be consulted on how to save money and reduce inefficiencies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing normal about what is happening. There\u2019s nothing normal about the impact that it is having and can have,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile politics has always had an impact on health, I do not believe that politics should be the driving force of decisions. There\u2019s never been a time in history where that happening has benefited our children and the sickest amongst us.\u201d",

      "title": "Ontario measles outbreak continues unabated, prompting New York state to issue travel advisory",
      "text": "The highly contagious measles virus continues to race through Ontario, with 155 new cases recorded over the past week, adding to an outbreak that has prompted New York state to issue a travel advisory urging residents to get vaccinated before crossing the northern border.\n\nIn its weekly update released Thursday, Public Health Ontario said there have been 816 measles cases diagnosed in the province since last October. Roughly one-fifth of the caseload has been reported over the past week, with 138 infections confirmed and 17 considered probable. Cases have been mostly concentrated in Southern Ontario and appeared in two additional public health units this week.\n\n\u201cThe sharp increase in the number of outbreak cases and the geographic spread in recent weeks is due to continued exposures and transmission among individuals who have not been immunized,\u201d the report states.\n\nIn depth: On the ground in the epicentre of Ontario\u2019s measles outbreak\n\nThe province is experiencing the worst outbreak since measles was declared eliminated in Canada in 1988 after widespread vaccination. Measles activity has since largely been connected to travel, also referred to as \u201cmeasles importation,\u201d said the provincial agency. An increase in global measles activity last year is now rearing its head in Canada, particularly in Ontario and Manitoba.\n\nThe New York State Department of Health issued a travel advisory last week that highlighted Ontario\u2019s outbreak and how easily the virus can jump from one person to another.\n\n\u201cMeasles is only a car ride away!\u201d reads the April 2 advisory. \u201cAround 90 per cent of people who are exposed to a person with measles will become infected if they are not vaccinated. Because measles is so contagious, it easily crosses borders.\u201d\n\nThe best form of protection is the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, it said. One dose is about 93-per-cent effective at preventing measles; two doses, about 97-per-cent effective.\n\n\u201cCurrently, measles outbreaks are happening in parts of the United States and Canada, especially in Ontario, and around the world. With spring and summer travel season approaching, anyone who is not protected can get measles while travelling and can easily spread it to others when they return home,\u201d the advisory said.\n\nOntario chief medical officer stands by vaccine exemption law despite rising measles cases\n\nNearly 500 U.S. cases have been reported in the first three months of this year, surpassing the total number of measles infections in all of 2024. The majority of cases have been identified in Texas and New Mexico, primarily among children who have not received the vaccine. In Texas, two children have died.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of sowing doubt about vaccines, recently endorsed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in a social media post. But in a separate post, he also praised doctors who used unproven treatments for measles.\n\nThere have been no deaths in Ontario, but 61 cases have required hospitalization. All but four of those patients were not immunized against measles, including 47 children.\n\nNinh Tran, the medical officer of health at Southwestern Public Health, serving a region south and east of London, which is bearing the brunt of the provincial outbreak, said in an update Thursday that 343 cases have been reported to the health unit since October. He spoke directly to parents and guardians in the region.\n\n\u201cIf your child is already four and awaiting their second dose, don\u2019t delay getting it, especially if you live, travel, play or worship in an area such as ours experiencing a measles outbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your child is younger than four and has an exposure during this outbreak, talk to your health care provider about options for a second dose.\u201d\n\nVaccinations, across all ages, increased 130 per cent from Jan. 1 to April 8 over the same period last year, Dr. Tran said. That\u2019s 940 additional doses in arms, an increase of 535 over last year.",

      "title": "Vaccine advisory panel, a frequent target of Kennedy, meets with little drama",
      "text": "A meeting of vaccine advisers long targeted by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unfolded Tuesday seemingly without fireworks or interference, although the new administration\u2019s imprint could be seen from the start, when staff for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gutted by layoffs, struggled to get a livestream running.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working through some broadcasting issues,\u201d said ACIP chair Keipp Talbot, to begin the meeting. \u201cAs you may have noticed, there have been some changes with the recent reduction in force, including to our communications group.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department abruptly cancelled the February meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, a 60-year-old body that provides recommendations for how vaccines should be deployed across the country. Public health professionals were relieved to see the committee reconvened but nervous about potential interference from a department now run by the country\u2019s most prominent vaccine critic.\n\nFor nine hours, though, experts walked through dense data on vaccines for Covid-19, mpox and HPV, as well as shots in development for Lyme disease and cytomegalovirus, which can cause devastating complications for newborns.\n\nWhen the growing measles outbreak came up, committee members stressed the importance of vaccination but avoided direct confrontation with Kennedy, who has at times urged people to get the measles vaccine but also pushed ineffective treatments and downplayed the scale of the epidemic.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cI find it absolutely devastating we\u2019re having this update today \u2014 there\u2019s no reason why we have healthy children dying of measles in the U.S. when this vaccine is amazing,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly effective and has very long lasting immunity.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s name was not mentioned. But when asked if there were enough resources to stem the outbreak, David Sugerman, the CDC\u2019s measles team lead, acknowledged that the agency was struggling.\n\nHe pointed to \u201cCovid-19 funds dissipating,\u201d an apparent reference to the administration\u2019s move \u2014 currently in legal limbo \u2014 to recess $11 billion in Covid funding to local public health departments. In Texas, local officials said the cuts would impair their response. Kennedy claimed he had no idea the funds had been rescinded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to support what we can, but I\u2019m assuming that if this is going to be ongoing, that those will be significant financial resources needed,\u201d Sugerman said. He added that responses to measles cases are estimated to cost $30,000 to $50,000 apiece. \u201cThat adds up quite quickly\u2026 we are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nKathryn Edwards, a longtime vaccinologist at Vanderbilt University and former ACIP member, said she was pleased with the meeting.\n\n\u201cI did not listen to every minute of the session today but when I did listen it seemed pretty much like usual,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIt seemed people were asking questions as usual.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not clear what that means for vaccine policy more broadly. Looming over the meeting was an unstated question: Is the FDA still properly reviewing vaccines?\n\nEarlier this month, the agency declined to approve Novavax\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine, despite reviewers having cleared it for approval. The move, still not fully explained, raised questions around whether the agency will approve a next-generation Covid-19 shot from Moderna at the end of April.\n\nTracy Beth H\u00f8eg, a rehabilitation medicine specialist and epidemiologist who rose to prominence during the pandemic as a skeptic of Covid policies and now serves a top aide to FDA commissioner Marty Makary, reportedly played a role in the Novavax decision. She attended the meeting as the agency\u2019s ex officio but demurred when asked about the move.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is a good question!\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know to what extent I\u2019m allowed to give an update on that, but there will be an update coming out publicly very soon.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, members discussed data around the new Moderna shot, which provoked higher levels of antibodies at a lower dose in clinical trials, and whether to adjust recommendations for all Covid vaccines to be more tailored to specific risk groups. H\u00f8eg spoke repeatedly throughout the morning, mostly voicing skepticism or asking a seemingly basic question about vaccine study design.\n\nThe administration\u2019s imprint was seen in at least one other area. Early in the morning, the committee considered whether to revise a previous recommendation for Jynneos, the vaccine for mpox, which had sparked a 2022 outbreak that disproportionately affected men who had sex with men and transgender people.\n\nThe previous recommendation had included transgender and nonbinary individuals among groups in defining at-risk. But on Tuesday, \u201ctransgender\u201d and \u201cnonbinary\u201d individuals had been removed, in compliance with an executive order to scrub references to transgender people from federal documents.\n\nThe committee was skeptical of a proposed change for expanding a recommendation for routine mpox vaccination to cover at-risk adolescents. CDC scientists saw it as a logical step now that new data from adolescent trials were in, but outside experts were uncertain about rolling out a vaccine for a virus that has infected only a handful of adolescents in the U.S. over the last couple of years.\n\nThey also noted Jynneos can cost over $200. \u201cThis seems like an extraordinary expenditure of resources for a very small number of cases,\u201d said Jamie Loehr, an adviser and a family physician in Rochester, New York.\n\nIn the end, committee members simply seemed glad they were able to conduct the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe were anticipating a lot of challenges today, most of which didn\u2019t materialize,\u201d said ACIP executive secretary Melinda Wharton.",

      "title": "Using International Arbitration to Resolve Retaliatory Tariff Disputes in Global Supply Chains",
      "text": "As trade tensions rise, retaliatory tariffs are disrupting global supply chains\u2014particularly in the automotive industry and other manufacturing sectors. These unexpected costs are sparking disputes over who should bear the financial burden under cross-border contracts. International arbitration is increasingly seen as the forum of choice for resolving these conflicts.\n\nRetaliatory Tariffs Disrupting Global Supply Chains\n\nRetaliatory tariffs\u2014duties imposed by one country in response to another\u2019s tariffs\u2014have lately become a harsh reality. These tit-for-tat measures are upending global supply chains, especially in the manufacturing sector. Companies suddenly face higher import costs, squeezed profit margins, and unpredictable regulations as countries strike back with their own duties. The automotive industry is particularly exposed, as tariffs on steel, aluminum, or automotive parts drive up production costs and disrupt just-in-time supply lines. In short, retaliatory duties are injecting uncertainty at every tier of global manufacturing.\n\nThis uncertainty is not just an economic nuisance\u2014it\u2019s a legal flashpoint. Contracts that once made financial sense can become unprofitable or impossible to perform when an unexpected tariff hits. Common points of contention include:\n\nWho pays for newly imposed tariffs\u2014supplier or buyer?\n\nCan pricing be adjusted when costs spike?\n\nIs non-performance excused under force majeure or hardship clauses?\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen cases of suppliers threatening to halt deliveries or buyers refusing shipments because a new tariff tipped a deal into the red. Such scenarios often trigger formal disputes. Many companies are discovering too late that their agreements didn\u2019t fully account for politically driven tariff shocks. In this turbulent landscape, businesses need a robust way to resolve disputes fairly and efficiently\u2014and so they are increasingly considering international arbitration.\n\nWhy International Arbitration Works\n\nInternational arbitration offers a neutral, enforceable, efficient, confidential, and competence-driven way to resolve these disputes:\n\nNeutrality. Unlike court litigation, where you might end up suing or being sued by a foreign partner in an unfamiliar legal system, arbitration provides a neutral forum agreed upon by both parties. Companies can avoid the \u201chome court\u201d advantage that one side would have in its local courts. In arbitration, the dispute is heard by an independent tribunal, often with arbitrators of neutral nationalities. This level playing field is crucial when a tariff dispute pits businesses from different countries against each other.\n\nEnforceability. Another major advantage is enforceability. An arbitration award (the final decision of the arbitrators) can be enforced almost anywhere in the world, thanks to a treaty called the New York Convention. Over 170 countries\u2014including the U.S., EU nations, China, Mexico, and many others\u2014are signatories to the New York Convention, which obligates their courts to recognize and enforce foreign arbitral awards. This means if a manufacturer wins an arbitration against an overseas supplier, the award can be taken to the supplier\u2019s home country and converted into a local court judgment for payment. Such global reach is not guaranteed with a normal court judgment, which might not be enforceable abroad. For businesses facing losses from a tariff dispute, knowing that any resolution will hold up internationally can be a huge relief.\n\nEfficiency: International arbitration is also typically faster and more flexible than litigating through court systems in multiple countries. Procedural rules can be streamlined in arbitration, which can significantly speed things along. There is only a limited right to appeal. Many arbitral institutions have expedited rules, and some allow the parties to resolve their disputes remotely via Teams or Zoom.\n\nExpertise: The fact that parties can select arbitrators with industry experience can also help to resolve disputes more quickly than in court. An arbitrator who understands customs duties, supply chains, manufacturing timelines, the auto industry, and standard international commercial terms will grasp the issues more quickly than most judges and juries. Arbitrators with relevant expertise can expeditiously determine whether a dispute can be resolved with money damages, or whether it instead should be resolved with emergency interim relief such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, both of which arbitrators typically have the power to award.\n\nConfidentiality: Unlike litigation in court, arbitration proceedings are private and confidential by default, which helps companies manage sensitive commercial issues outside the spotlight.\n\nPractical Steps for Companies to Protect Themselves\n\nIn the short term, you should consider adding an arbitration clause to your agreements or updating the one you already have. Alternatively, if you\u2019re already in the midst of a dispute, and you don\u2019t have an arbitration clause in your supply agreement, you and your counterparty can nevertheless agree to arbitrate your dispute. Ask your lawyer to help you select the arbitration rules and institution\u2014such as the International Chamber of Commerce, International Centre for Dispute Resolution, or Singapore International Arbitration Centre, among others\u2014that best fit your needs.\n\nSelect the governing law carefully. The governing law is the national law that will be used to interpret the contract. This is important if, for instance, you want a legal system that recognizes sudden tariffs as a valid reason to adjust obligations, or, conversely, one that enforces contracts strictly.\n\nSelect the seat of arbitration (legal place of the arbitration) carefully. The seat determines the procedural framework, and which courts have limited oversight of the arbitration. Choose a seat in a neutral, arbitration-friendly jurisdiction such as New York, London, Singapore, or Geneva.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs are likely to remain a feature of international trade for the foreseeable future, and global manufacturers\u2014especially in industries like automotive, where supply chains cross many borders\u2014will continue to feel the effects. International arbitration has emerged as a critical tool for resolving the disputes that inevitably arise from these trade frictions. It offers a neutral, enforceable, and effective way to get parties back on track when a deal is derailed by retaliatory tariffs. Businesses should see international arbitration not as a last resort, but as a built-in safety valve that can give all sides confidence to continue trading despite an uncertain tariff environment.",

      "title": "Trump\u2019s Dilemma: A Trade War That Threatens Every Other Negotiation With China",
      "text": "President Trump came into office sounding as if he were eager to deal with President Xi Jinping of China on the range of issues dividing the world\u2019s two biggest superpowers.\n\nHe and his aides signaled that they wanted to resolve trade disputes and lower the temperature on Taiwan, curb fentanyl production and get to a deal on TikTok. Perhaps, over time, they could manage a revived nuclear arms race and competition over artificial intelligence.\n\nToday it is hard to imagine any of that happening, at least for a year.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to stake everything on winning a trade war with China threatens to choke off those negotiations before they even begin. And if they do start up, Mr. Trump may be entering them alone, because he has alienated the allies who in recent years had come to a common approach to countering Chinese power.\n\nIn conversations over the past 10 days, several administration officials, insisting that they could not speak on the record, described a White House deeply divided on how to handle Beijing. The trade war erupted before the many factions inside the administration even had time to stake out their positions, much less decide which issues mattered most.\n\n\u201cWhat is the Trump administration\u2019s grand strategy for China?\u201d said Rush Doshi, one of America\u2019s leading China strategists, who is now at the Council of Foreign Relations and Georgetown University. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a grand strategy yet. They have a range of disconnected tactics.\u201d\n\nMr. Doshi says he holds open the hope that Mr. Trump could reach deals with Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan and the European Union that would allow them to confront Chinese trade practices together, attract allied investment in U.S. industry and increase security ties.\n\n\u201cIf you are up against someone big, you need to get bigger scale \u2014 and that\u2019s why we need our allies to be with us,\u201d said Mr. Doshi, who in recent days published an article in Foreign Affairs with Kurt M. Campbell, the former deputy secretary of state, arguing for a new approach. \u201cThis is an era in which strategic advantage will once again accrue to those who can operate at scale. China possesses scale, and the United States does not \u2014 at least not by itself,\u201d they wrote.\n\nMr. Trump insisted on Monday that his tariffs were working so well that he might place more of them on China, among other nations. Just 48 hours after he carved out a huge exemption for cellphones, computer equipment and many electronic components \u2014 nearly a quarter of all trade with China \u2014 he said he might soon announce additional tariffs targeting imported computer chips and pharmaceuticals. \u201cThe higher the tariff, the faster they come in,\u201d he said of companies investing in the United States to avoid paying the import tax.\n\nSo far, the Chinese response has been one of controlled escalation. Beijing has matched every one of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff hikes, trying to send the message that it can endure the pain longer than the United States can. And in a move that appeared to experts to have been prepared months ago, China announced that it was suspending exports of a range of critical minerals and magnets used by automakers, semiconductor producers and weapons builders \u2014 a reminder to Washington that Beijing has many tools to interrupt supply chains.\n\nThe result, said R. Nicholas Burns, who left his post in January as the American ambassador to China, is \u201cone of the most serious crises in U.S.-Chinese relations since the resumption of full diplomatic relations in 1979.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Americans should have no sympathy for the Chinese government, which describes itself as the victim in this confrontation,\u201d said Mr. Burns. \u201cThey have been the greatest disrupter in the international trade system.\u201d He said the challenge now would be \u201cto restore communications at the highest levels to avoid a decoupling of the two economies.\u201d\n\nSo far, neither side wants to be the one to initiate those communications, at least in public, for fear of being perceived as the one that blinked. Mr. Trump often insists he has a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with Mr. Xi, but he gave the Chinese leader no direct warning about what was coming \u2014 or a pathway to head it off. And Mr. Xi has pointedly avoided joining the ranks of what the White House insists are 75 countries that say they want to strike a deal.\n\nThere are flickers of back-channel communications: Cui Tiankai, who served as China\u2019s ambassador to the United States from 2013 to 2021, was in Washington as the tariffs were rolling out, talking to old contacts and clearly looking for a way to defuse the growing confrontation. Though retired, Mr. Cui is still among the Chinese with deep connections in both capitals \u2014 he is a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and American officials still use him as a conduit to the Chinese leadership.\n\nBut recent history suggests that freezes in the U.S.-China relationship can be long-lasting and that relations never quite get back to where they had been before. The August 2022 visit to Taiwan by a congressional delegation led by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who at the time was still the speaker of the House, led China to send its air and naval forces on military exercises over the \u201cmedian line\u201d in the Taiwan Strait. Nearly three years later, those exercises have only intensified.\n\nThe following winter a high-altitude balloon, which China claimed was a weather balloon and U.S. intelligence officials said was stuffed with intelligence-gathering equipment to geolocate communications transmissions, crossed over the continental United States. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ultimately ordered it shot down off the South Carolina coast.\n\nBut the stakes in those confrontations were not as high as they are in the emerging trade war, which could help push both countries to the brink of recession \u2014 and could ultimately spill into the power plays happening each day around Taiwan, in the South China Sea and just offshore of the Philippines.\n\nAmong the questions hanging over the administration now is whether it can put together a coherent approach to China at a moment when key members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle are arguing in public about the right strategy. Elon Musk, who relies on China as a key supplier to his companies Tesla and SpaceX, called Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, a \u201cmoron\u201d and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Mr. Navarro shrugged it off during a Sunday appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back Monday on a Chinese commerce official who dismissed the tariffs as a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are not a joke,\u201d Mr. Bessent said in Argentina, where he is on a visit. But then he added that the tariffs were so big that \u201cno one thinks they\u2019re sustainable.\u201d\n\nBut whether they are sustainable is a different question than whether Mr. Trump or Mr. Xi can afford, politically, to be the first to back away from them. And then the administration will have to decide what its priorities are when it comes to China. Will the United States declare that it will defend Taiwan? (Mr. Trump clearly has his hesitations, based on his public statements.) Will it seek to find common projects to work on with Beijing?\n\nIt is hardly unusual for an administration to spend months, maybe more than a year, debating how to navigate a relationship as complex as the one with China. President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger spent years plotting out their approach to what was still called \u201cRed China,\u201d resulting in Mr. Nixon\u2019s historic trip to the country and the yearslong diplomatic opening it triggered. President Bill Clinton entered office having campaigned against the \u201cbutchers of Beijing,\u201d a reference to the killings in Tiananmen Square and the crackdowns that followed, and he ended his term ushering China into the World Trade Organization. President George W. Bush courted Chinese leaders to join the battle against terrorism.\n\nMr. Biden had to get beyond the Covid era before he settled on a strategy of denying Beijing access to critical semiconductors and other technology.\n\nBut none was trying to overcome what Mr. Trump faces. He has unleashed an act of economic confrontation so large that it may poison the relationship with a country that is deeply intertwined with the American economy. In the end, Mr. Trump may have to choose between an unhappy marriage or an abrupt divorce.",

      "title": "Trump\u2019s trade war is boom time for one profession: lawyers",
      "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s new blizzard of tariffs is a nightmare for many companies. But one profession can expect an increase in business: lawyers.\n\nThe legal industry is expecting a wave of litigation as companies scramble to renegotiate contracts with overseas suppliers that are now subject to tariffs. The unexpected trade barriers will also certainly lead to a rise in disputes as companies squabble over who bears the cost of the new system.\n\nOther have even suggested the entire tariff system may in fact be overturned in the courts. In the view of the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board, Trump simply lacks the authority to impose such sweeping taxes on trade, meaning a legal challenge would be viable.\n\nMeanwhile, both China and Canada have already filed complaints to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), seeking to challenge the US levies through international law. The WTO, headquartered in Geneva, in Switzerland, was in theory set up to deal with exactly the type of situation the world currently faces.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s opponents will probably struggle to overturn the tariffs, either through the WTO or America\u2019s own courts. With respect for international institutions currently at a low ebb, challenges through the WTO seem futile. The sweeping powers granted to America\u2019s president under US law also mean challenges in domestic courts could also be doomed to fail.\n\nCountries including Canada and China have already launched retaliatory tariffs of their own, a signal that world leaders are not holding out much hope for a legal or negotiated settlement.\n\nThe WTO is currently the main international body that deals with trade disputes between countries, meaning it is the obvious venue for those seeking to challenge Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nIn theory, countries would also have a strong case. Yet the WTO is currently weaker than ever, largely as a result of attacks from both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nThe US has worked to block all appointments to the WTO\u2019s top Appellate Body, which acts as the WTO\u2019s Supreme Court. The Trump administration last week also froze US funding for the WTO.\n\nThe situation means the WTO is unable to make any rulings on whether the US levies breach its free trade rules, as the Appellate Body lacks the judges it needs to make such decisions.\n\nThe stalemate gives the US the option to \u201cappeal into the void\u201d in order to prevent the Geneva-based body from actually reaching any final decision on the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs.\n\nProfessor Catherine Rogers, of Bocconi University, says the state of the WTO means there is \u201cnot currently a viable mechanism for states to bring legal claims against the US\u201d.\n\nRoland Scarlett, a trade lawyer at Fieldfisher, adds that while there are \u201cvery strong grounds\u201d on which countries might challenge Trump\u2019s levies in principle, the \u201cweakened state\u201d of the WTO means any challenge is likely to have little impact outside of \u201cmoral signalling\u201d.\n\nTrump would be very likely to ignore any orders made by the WTO anyway. He did so when it ruled his 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminium imports were unlawful. Trump has repeatedly criticised the WTO for being biased towards China and for working to the detriment of US workers and businesses. The US president has also threatened to pull America out of the WTO entirely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely convinced that the Trump administration will listen to any ruling,\u201d says David Savage, a regulatory lawyer at HFW.\n\nAdditionally, lawyers point out that WTO resolutions to trade disputes typically take years to come to fruition, even when the Geneva-based body is functioning properly.\n\nThe other option would be for investors and companies to challenge Trump\u2019s tariffs through US courts, as was suggested by the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board last month.\n\nSpecifically, the paper questioned the extent to which Trump actually has the power to introduce tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, the legislation he used.\n\nThe law, which was signed in by former president Jimmy Carter, gives America\u2019s commander-in-chief sweeping powers to bring in new rules on international trade in response to \u201cany unusual and extraordinary threat\u201d to America\u2019s economy or national security from outside the US.\n\nThe act was first used to impose sanctions on Iran when 53 Americans were taken hostage inside the US embassy in Tehran in 1979. Since then, the law has mostly been used to impose targeted sanctions on specific entities or individuals.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal questioned the use of the law for the imposition of tariffs, rather than sanctions, and the extent to which America\u2019s fentanyl crisis could be deemed an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat\u201d.\n\nBut again, experts are doubtful whether a legal challenge would succeed. The Supreme Court is typically very reluctant to overturn executive orders, including in relation to tariffs.\n\nProfessor Evan Zoldan, of the Legal Institute of the Great Lakes, says: \u201cUnder US law, the Supreme Court specifically upheld the president\u2019s power to impose tariffs nearly 100 years ago in a case called J.W. Hampton Jr. & Co. v. United States (1928). In that case, challengers argued that the tariff statute unlawfully delegated too much discretion to the president. But, the Court upheld the power.\u201d\n\nAnyone seeking to overturn Trump\u2019s tariffs would therefore likely be forced to do so by limiting the president\u2019s power to impose levies at all, which would require changing US law through America\u2019s Congress.\n\n\u201cUnder a series of existing statutes, the president has broad authority to impose tariffs. Because the authority is statutory, Congress could pass a law revoking, limiting, or conditioning this authority at any time,\u201d Prof Zoldan says.\n\nStill, the problem with this approach is that Trump himself would have a veto.\n\n\u201cAny new law doing so would be subject to veto by the president ... and although this veto, in turn, could be overridden by Congress if enough members vote to do so, it is unlikely that there are enough votes in Congress to override a presidential veto on tariffs, even if Congress were to agree on a bill limiting the president\u2019s power over tariffs in the first place,\u201d Prof Zoldan says.\n\nUltimately, the best chance of softening Trump\u2019s tariffs is likely to be through diplomacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a carrot-and-stick approach,\u201d Mr Savage says. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an incredibly large amount of diplomacy, both in front of the cameras and behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nBut as the world quakes at the prospect of a global recession, lawyers can at least sleep easy knowing that they\u2019ll be kept busy.",

      "title": "Washington disrupting global trade system",
      "text": "China has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the US decision to raise the \"reciprocal tariffs\", the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced on Wednesday.\n\nWhat's worse, on the same day US President Donald Trump raised the additional tariffs to 125 percent, hours after China took a countermeasure of an additional 84 percent duties on American goods.\n\nThe world is undergoing unprecedented changes, marked by a shift in the global power structure and a full-scale rewriting of international rules. The US has been ignoring established norms and making a mockery of the rule of law.\n\nDiscriminatory trade laws and unilateral sanctions, for some countries, have become the order of the day, pushing global legal frameworks into a crisis. The surge in trade disputes, compounded by the paralysis of the World Trade Organization's Appellate Body, has led many countries to bypass multilateral solutions in favor of retaliatory actions.\n\nThe rise of unilateral, discriminatory trade measures has intensified disputes between countries, turning global trade from a cooperative effort into a zero-sum game. The very foundation of the global trading system is crumbling because international relations are no longer anchored by rules or legal frameworks. In such a situation, the global trade system is bound to collapse, dragging the world into a potential disaster.\n\nGlobal trade isn't only about the exchange of goods; it's the \"engine \"driving global economic growth and the \"ballast\" preventing the ship of global peace from capsizing. But this engine runs on rules, rules that guarantee fairness, transparency and predictability.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the United States and other developed countries devised the global trade system, laying special emphasis on multilateralism. As the chief architect of the postwar multilateral order and a founding member of the WTO, the US has led the charge in promoting these trade rules. Yet today the US seems to have consigned the very spirit of multilateralism that it helped build to the trash can. Instead of leading by example, the US is increasingly undermining the system it once championed.\n\nThe struggle for global economic dominance has turned into a contest over the rules that govern global trade. In this new \"rules war\", the US has been using \"national security\" as a pretext to impose trade and investment restrictions on China, including sanctions on semiconductor exports. In its latest move, the US administration has violated the WTO's most-favored-nation principle and slapped massive additional tariffs on Chinese goods on the pretext of safeguarding \"national security\" and protecting the interests of American industries.\n\nThis brazen violation of international law has put international trade relations in peril, making it clear the US, instead of being a champion of the rules-based world order, has become a disrupter of global trade and violator of international rules.\n\nChina's efforts to reshape the global trade system is not aimed at dismantling the existing global trade framework; they are meant to breathe new life into multilateralism, and reform the WTO to make it fairer, and more equitable and representative. China wants to engage in rule-making to ensure global trade rules reflect the changing international landscape and align with the world's highest standards, exemplified by agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nChina is stepping up to the plate with a clear goal: to build a global trade system that is open, fair and cooperative in nature. It is committed to promoting a model of shared opportunities, advocating trade and investment liberalization, and creating a level playing field where every country can thrive.\n\nAs part of this reshaping process, China aims to secure a seat at the table to discuss the future of global trade, and have a say in global economic affairs commensurate with its growing economic power and influence. The global trade rules need to be upgraded to reflect the global economic reality of today, and China is determined to be at the center of that evolution. This means pushing for a greater role in setting the global economic governance agenda.\n\nAs for the WTO, it is more than just a trade body; it is the upholder of multilateralism. The rules-based WTO has been a crucial force fostering global economic cooperation, which China firmly supports. China has been calling for the revival of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism to ensure the global trade system is fair and balanced. The \"Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement\", an alternative system for resolving WTO disputes and a temporary solution to the WTO dispute settlement crisis, which China established in cooperation with the European Union, is just one example of China's proactive role in promoting multilateralism.\n\nThe WTO must be reinvigorated, and global trade should once again be governed by law. Trade should be a pillar for the development and future prosperity of all our people. If we are to navigate the tumultuous waters of global economic uncertainty and achieve common prosperity, the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core, will be our most important anchor.\n\nThe views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.",

      "title": "The housing market's spring selling season is here. Can buyers catch a break?",
      "text": "As real estate's spring selling season begins, Thai Hung Nguyen has his fingers crossed.\n\nNguyen, a real estate agent with Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Premier, works in the metro Washington, D.C., area, where a significant percentage of residents are employed by or contract with the federal government.\n\nSo far, there are slightly more listings coming on the market \u2013 signaling people want to sell their home \u2013 than at this time last year, Nguyen said, but not enough to suggest a full-fledged retreat from the area as the Trump administration slashes the federal workforce.\n\nAt the same time, he said, he has fielded a few more calls than in past years from would-be buyers, even though some later decided to step away from the house hunt amid the uncertainty about jobs.\n\nNguyen's experience is a snapshot of the national housing market as buyers and sellers enter what is traditionally the busiest season of the year hopeful about moderating interest rates but wary of tariffs, stubborn inflation and consumer fears about jobs and the economy that could keep the market mired in a rut.\n\nSome observers even think the 2025 spring season might be one not seen in a number of years: an almost normal housing market, as close to evenly balanced between buyers and sellers as anything we've seen in a while.\n\nForecast for 2025 home sales\n\nSelma Hepp, chief economist with Cotality, the real estate data provider formerly known as CoreLogic, forecast 2025 home sales would be \u201cslightly above\u201d the pace set in 2024. In 2024, sales of previously owned homes were at the lowest level in three decades, so any improvement would be welcome.\n\nA few months into the year, Hepp is still cautiously optimistic. The pace of sales hasn't been gangbusters \u2013 up one month, down the next \u2013 but seems to be gradually picking up, she said in an interview.\n\n\u201cPart of the story this spring is more inventory, which is giving buyers more leverage,\" Hepp said. \"We do see a little bit more negotiations and discounting. The rate of home price appreciation is slow.\u201d\n\nData provided to USA TODAY by Realtor.com confirms those trends. Inventory for sale was up 29.2% last week compared with a year ago and has been higher than year-ago levels for three weeks in a row.\n\n\u201cPrices have been flat year-over-year for the last two weeks, and were just slightly lower annually the two weeks prior,\u201d said Hannah Jones, Realtor.com\u2019s senior economic research analyst, in an email. \u201cThese weekly trends suggest that prices will be close to last year's level, which was $425,000 in March 2024.\u201d\n\nBecause mortgage rates this month have been slightly lower than a year ago, the overall monthly payment may be a bit more manageable for buyers \u2013 as long as they remain employed and confident.\n\nHow are homebuilders faring?\n\nThere's another big concern, however, in some corners of the housing market. Significantly more inventory in the new-construction corner of the market isn't necessarily a good thing, and it seems builders may have overestimated demand in the past few months.\n\nNew-home sales were strong in February, the Census Bureau said Tuesday, but inventory was at its highest in 18 years. \u201cBuilders may need to continue to offer price cuts to clear their inventories, although that may become more challenging if tariffs significantly raise building costs,\u201d Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics, said in an analysis after the release.\n\n\u201cWe need to acknowledge that the 2025 spring selling season is off to a dismal start across the industry,\u201d Raymond James analyst Buck Horne wrote in a research note March 25 after the quarterly earnings report from national builder KB Home.\n\nThe company did discount its new homes \u201caggressively,\u201d Horne wrote. But he and other analysts remain concerned about buyer confidence. In an analysis of earnings from KB competitor Lennar Homes, Horne cited \u201cgrowing consumer concerns about the economy combined with the affordability challenges of a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 rate environment.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, says Nguyen, the real estate agent in metro D.C., consumers are more adaptable than some experts realize.\n\nWhen it comes to mortgage rates, he said, \"now people are comfortable in the sixes.\"",

      "title": "U.S. Prepares to Challenge Meta\u2019s Social Media Dominance",
      "text": "Soon after Mark Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, the social network skyrocketed in popularity. Roughly a decade later, the company experienced another round of explosive growth after buying its smaller rivals Instagram and WhatsApp, cementing its place in social media.\n\nOn Monday, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will begin considering a landmark monopoly case involving the company \u2014 now called Meta \u2014 that hinges on a novel legal question: Did it break the law to stay dominant by acquiring the start-ups that stood in its way?\n\nThe case \u2014 Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms \u2014 will for the first time try to stretch theories of U.S. antitrust law to include what regulators are calling a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy. Meta broke the law by acquiring nascent competitors to maintain its monopoly in social networking, the F.T.C. argues. Regulators are seeking to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta has countered that it faces ample competition in social media from TikTok, Snap, Reddit and LinkedIn, and that regulators approved the acquisitions at the time. The company also hasn\u2019t given up on settling the case: Early this month, Mr. Zuckerberg was at the White House to try to persuade the Trump administration to avert a trial.\n\nThe outcome of what is expected to be a multiweek trial, the first major tech case prosecuted by the Trump administration, could reshape the U.S. antitrust landscape as companies face intense scrutiny over mergers and acquisitions. A government victory could also have ripple effects for Silicon Valley, where start-ups bank on lucrative acquisitions by bigger companies for payouts.\n\nStill, the F.T.C. faces an uphill battle to prove its case, legal experts said. The government\u2019s legal argument hinges on showing that Meta would not be as dominant, and would not have stayed as dominant, if it hadn\u2019t acquired Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 a hypothetical situation that is difficult to prove because many factors have played into the company\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical test case for whether the antitrust laws can be used to unwind mergers designed to eliminate upstart competition,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior official in the antitrust division of the Department of Justice. \u201cA win for the government would give consumers more choices and opportunities to switch across social media platforms without having to be on Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department last year won an antitrust suit against Google for monopolizing internet search, and a trial to determine how to remedy that monopoly is slated to start on April 21. Google is also awaiting a judge\u2019s decision in a separate trial over claims that it illegally squashed competition in the ad tech market.\n\nThe D.O.J. has also sued Apple over claims that its tightly knit system of devices and software makes it challenging for consumers to leave. And the F.T.C. has sued Amazon, accusing it of illegally protecting a monopoly in online retail. Those cases are expected to go to trial next year.\n\nThe tech industry is closely watching the Meta trial, one of the first major signals of how aggressively President Trump may rein in the most powerful tech companies. The case originated under his first administration, before a handoff in 2021 to the F.T.C. chair Lina Khan, a Biden appointee who drew attention for her quest to break up tech monopolies.\n\nNow Andrew Ferguson, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the agency, has taken the baton. He has warned against concentrated power held by Meta. He is also motivated by a shared Republican view that tech platforms have censored content, particularly conservative voices.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to take our foot off the gas,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said in an interview last month with Bloomberg.\n\nFor Meta, even the idea of hiving off Instagram and WhatsApp is alarming. The company bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. At the time of the deals, the apps were small \u2014 Instagram had just 30 million users and 13 employees, while WhatsApp had 450 million users and 50 employees. Since then, both have become critical to Meta, with faster growth and engagement by users than Facebook.\n\nThe trial is expected to feature about seven hours of testimony from Mr. Zuckerberg, who will be a star witness, along with Meta\u2019s former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, and the founders of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta has an army of the most expensive and experienced litigators arguing its defense, led by Mark C. Hansen, a partner at Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. Meta plans to argue that the fast rise of the video-sharing site TikTok, in particular, shows healthy competition in the market.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the evidence at trial will show that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been good for competition and consumers,\u201d said Chris Sgro, a spokesman for Meta. \u201cThe commission is wrongly continuing to assert that no deal is ever truly final, and businesses can be punished for innovating.\u201d\n\nThe F.T.C. first sued Meta in December 2020, alongside a similar suit brought by 46 states. The agency\u2019s legal argument hinges on Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which specifies that it is illegal to maintain a monopoly by using anticompetitive practices \u2014 in this case, acquiring companies at a premium as a strategy to eliminate them as competitors.\n\nTo support its case, the F.T.C. plans to present a 2008 email from Mr. Zuckerberg saying, \u201cIt is better to buy than compete\u201d and a 2012 memo he wrote saying that his motivation for buying Instagram was \u201cneutral[izing] a potential competitor.\u201d\n\nJudge Boasberg, who has been locked in a contentious court battle with the Trump administration over its use of a powerful wartime statute to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants, will decide the case. During a recent pretrial tutorial, the judge said he had never had a personal Facebook or Instagram account.\n\nJudge Boasberg rejected the F.T.C.\u2019s initial case in June 2021, saying the agency needed to provide stronger definitions for the social media market and how Meta had come to monopolize it. He accepted a refiled version of the case in January 2022, but cautioned that it was far from a slam dunk.\n\nIn a ruling against Meta\u2019s motion to dismiss the case last year, Judge Boasberg said the F.T.C. \u201cfaces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, its positions at times strain this country\u2019s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits,\u201d he added.",

      "text": "The Cypriot insurance industry is experiencing heightened merger and acquisition activity, mirroring developments in the banking sector, according to a report from Stockwatch.\n\nMajor Greek banks have recently pursued acquisitions of Cypriot financial institutions, and this trend is now extending to insurance, a sector seen as a lucrative avenue for expansion.\n\nFor years, the country\u2019s largest insurance firms have been tied to banking institutions. Bank of Cyprus owns Eurolife and General Insurance, which have consistently held leading positions in the life and general insurance markets.\n\nRecent data from the Insurance Association of Cyprus (IAC), covering the first nine months of 2024, shows that Eurolife recorded \u20ac140.8 million in life insurance premiums, securing a market share of 28.9 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, General Insurance reported \u20ac49.8 million in general insurance premiums, representing 11.1 per cent of the market, maintaining their position as industry leaders.\n\nA major shift is expected with Hellenic Bank\u2019s pending acquisition of the CNP Group, which includes CNP Cyprialife and CNP Insurance.\n\nCNP Cyprialife, which currently holds a 23.8 per cent market share in life insurance, will see its combined share with Hellenic\u2019s existing 6.4 per cent reach 30.2 per cent\u2014overtaking Eurolife.\n\nSimilarly, CNP Insurance\u2019s 10.9 per cent share, when combined with the 7.5 per cent held by Pancyprian Insurance, already under Hellenic Bank, would total 18.4 per cent, significantly surpassing General Insurance\u2019s share.\n\nDespite initial concerns about the future of private insurance following the introduction of the General Healthcare System (Gesy) in Cyprus nearly five years ago, the sector has continued to expand.\n\nMany had expected private health insurance to decline, yet the industry has remained resilient and has even strengthened.\n\nFigures for the first nine months of 2024 show an increase of 9.7 per cent in life insurance business and a 5.5 per cent rise in general insurance activity.\n\nThis continued growth and the sector\u2019s rising profitability have attracted increased interest from large firms seeking to expand their presence through acquisitions.\n\nGiven the pace of economic expansion in Cyprus\u2014outstripping that of many European Union countries\u2014further mergers and acquisitions within the insurance market remain a strong possibility.",

In regulatory news, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with a trucker who was fired after testing positive for THC\u2014allegedly after consuming a hemp\u2011derived CBD product. The decision, reported by Marijuana Moment, allows the trucker to seek triple damages under a federal anti\u2011racketeering law.\n\nOn the policy front, extensive analysis of the federal cannabis rescheduling debate reveals that moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III would offer only modest benefits while leaving longstanding racial disparities and federal\u2013state conflicts unresolved. A Yale Law Journal forum article argues for decriminalization and deregulation instead of rescheduling.\n\nFederal Policy And Administration Developments\n\nA recent article by Marijuana Moment highlights that cannabis rescheduling is not among the Trump administration's top drug policy priorities. Instead, the administration is focusing on combating drug trafficking and the opioid crisis. While Trump had previously voiced support for cannabis rescheduling and medical cannabis legalization during his 2024 campaign, his current policy priorities emphasize enforcement against substances such as fentanyl, methamphetamines and heroin. This shift underscores the challenges and federal-state conflicts that continue to shape cannabis policy in the U.S.\n\nIndustry Challenges And Financial Distress\n\nThe sector continues to face significant financial challenges. A recent Benzinga article details defaults on key real estate leases by Gold Flora Corp., 4Front Ventures Corp. and TILT Holdings Inc. These defaults\u2014driven by escalating liabilities-to-market cap ratios and high operating costs\u2014signal a broader liquidity crisis that could threaten other operators such as Cannabist Holdings, Ascend Wellness Holdings and AYR Wellness.\n\nThe Bob Fireman Award\n\nNominations for the 2025 Bob Fireman Award for Entrepreneurship are now open. The award honors cannabis leaders who embody the legacy of Robert \u201cBob\u201d Fireman\u2014co-founder and former CEO of MariMed Inc. MRMD.
