In the UK, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 refer specifically to biological women and biological sex. The decision followed a legal challenge by For Women Scotland regarding female representation on public boards and has nationwide implications for sex-based rights and single-sex services. While the court emphasized that the ruling should not be seen as a victory for any group at the expense of another, it clarified that trans people remain protected from discrimination under the law. The Scottish government, which argued that those with a Gender Recognition Certificate should be recognized as women, said it would work with Westminster to assess the ruling’s impact. In the US, the Supreme Court backed the Trump administration’s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation. The 5-4 decision allows deportations to proceed but requires that individuals be given notice and the opportunity to contest their removal on a case-by-case basis, rather than through class action. The ruling does not address the constitutionality of the act or provide recourse for those already deported without due process. Dissenting justices warned of the dangers of major decisions made through the court’s emergency docket and highlighted concerns about due process and executive overreach."

Companies now face higher costs, squeezed margins, and contract disputes over who should bear the burden of new tariffs, often leading to halted deliveries or refused shipments. This legal uncertainty is fueling a boom in litigation and driving businesses toward international arbitration, which offers neutrality, enforceability, and confidentiality for resolving cross-border disputes. Efforts to challenge U.S. tariffs through the World Trade Organization (WTO) are hampered by the paralysis of its Appellate Body and skepticism toward international institutions. The U.S. has blocked appointments and cut funding, rendering the WTO largely ineffective in resolving these disputes. Legal challenges in U.S. courts also face long odds, as presidential authority over tariffs is broad and historically upheld.
