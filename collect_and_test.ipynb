It has real-life applications in India which can tremendously range from tracking food safety and preventing counterfeiting activities and finally to cost reduction.', 'url': 'https://www.outlookindia.com/xhub/blockchain-insights/blockchain-in-supply-chain-real-world-applications-in-india', 'full_text': \"Understanding Supply Chain Management in Blockchain\\n\\nBlockchain is a decentralized, immutable digital ledger that guarantees secure, transparent transactions. Unlike traditional databases that consolidate their control in one place, blockchain guarantees that data is always distributed across many nodes, making it nearly impossible to alter or manipulate. This decentralized aspect fortifies the trust and security of supply chains, as every transaction must be verified by all network participants prior to being timestamped in the ledger.\\n\\nIn India, the government and private enterprises are exploring blockchain applications in supply chain management. Both NITI Aayog and different state governments have commenced pilot studies focusing on the integration of blockchain into industries such as food safety, pharmaceuticals, and logistics for increased traceability and efficiency.\\n\\nEnhancing Transparency and Traceability\\n\\nEnhanced transparency in supply chains is the major benefit that blockchain brings. Traditionally, tracking a product's journey from source to consumer involves a plethora of intermediaries and paperwork. Such processes are tedious and prone to error and fraud. Blockchain virtually eliminates these inefficiencies through a tamper-proof record of every transaction being available to all authorized participants.\\n\\nIn India, the agricultural sector has seen the implementation of blockchain for food traceability. The Andhra Pradesh state government has collaborated with technology companies in using blockchain to track crop supply chains such as chili and coffee. This will ensure the farmers get a fair price while the consumers get to authenticate their produce.\\n\\nCombating Counterfeiting and Fraud\\n\\nCounterfeiting is a big headache in the different industries-from pharma to luxury goods. Counterfeit products cause not only financial harm but also potential health and safety risks. Blockchain technology provides a way to solve these issues through a tamper-proof record of product origins and ownership transfers.\\n\\nThe Indian pharmaceutical industry is applying blockchain technology to counter fake medicines. In collaboration with blockchain companies, the Maharashtra FDA set up a system for tracking medicines from manufacture to retail, thus ensuring the sale of authentic drugs to patients while also curtailing illegal distribution.\\n\\nImproving Efficiency and Reducing Costs\\n\\nBlockchain streamlines these processes by automating transactions through smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts when certain conditions are attained. Automating such transactions reduces overhead costs and delays that add complexity to logistics, the involvement of multiple intermediaries, and vast volumes of paperwork that are features of traditional supply chains.\\n\\nMajor port authorities that are penetrating blockchain solutions in India's logistics domain are more or less such as the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) as well. Allowing real-time visibility in the movement of cargo and automating documentation can greatly shorten clearance times and efficiency in trade.\\n\\nStrengthening Ethical and Sustainable Practices\\n\\nIncreased consumer awareness about ethical and environmental concerns has put pressure on businesses to adopt sustainable and responsible sourcing methods. Transparency in the supply chain enables the company to trace and verify the origin of raw materials, thus ensuring ethical sources.\\n\\nIn the textile sector, Indian manufacturers are implementing blockchain to verify organic cotton; thus, brands that export to the global markets are made to explain sourcing and production processes, which gives rise to trustworthy consumers and promotes ethical practices.\\n\\nConfronting Challenges and Limitations\\n\\nDespite thrilling promise, blockchain undoubtedly faces potential intrinsic issues in their real-life application in supply chain management. The scaling problem is one of the most severe issues because of the huge volume of data that supply chains produce over time. It busts even the current capacities of blockchain, and invariably there needs to be ongoing innovations to come through improvements in scalability and transaction speeds.\\n\\nIntegrating the already functioning supply chain frameworks with blockchain technology needs collaboration from several stakeholders. Investment in introducing new technology in that case through standards for data sharing also has to be agreed upon by organizations. There are other aspects, like legal and regulatory ones as well, as every state may have different specifications regarding Blockchain use cases, for example, within India.\\n\\nThe Future of Blockchain in Supply Chain in India\\n\\nThe application of blockchain technology in supply chain management will increase with growing awareness by businesses and industries of its significance. Scaling solutions for blockchain, fused with artificial intelligence and IoT, would provide better transparency and efficiency in the supply chain. Future possibilities may come in the form of fully automated, blockchain-integrated supply chains where real-time product tracking is done, payments are made seamlessly through smart contracts, and predictive analytics help optimize logistics. Such innovations will transform the dynamics of business operation and consumer engagement. The Indian government is also working on a national-level framework for blockchain, which might uphold a more integrated and secured supply chain ecosystem.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nBlockchain makes transformation in supply chain management offering clarity, efficiency and security. It has real-life applications in India which can tremendously range from tracking food safety and preventing counterfeiting activities and finally to cost reduction. However, for all the challenges which still remain, innovation and partnership would pave the way to blockchain being widely adopted across supply chain networks in India. These would make it possible for businesses and consumers to remain accountable and sustainable- thus making strong changes in supply chains in the country by the time blockchain becomes a common name.\"}\n"

            "The buzzword of the circular economy is part and parcel of the global discourse on climate change. Despite this marked shift, the response to climate change-related issues and challenges is not significant across nations. Forces of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation are exerting pressure on state governments to ease the process of forest clearance for mining. The political economy of the carbon emissions and its trade between the Global South and Northern countries is one of the major factors for the lack of consensus. It also highlights the inadequacy of the market structure to facilitate the climatic action plan among the developed and developing nations. The emergence and commitment of the European Union (EU) in the form of Green Deal to an extent is the silver lining in achieving the target of SDGs by 2030, especially Goal 13. 10 out of 13 indicators still in Tier III. This needs revisiting the economic growth model by improving institutional capacities of the state along the lines of redistributive justice. ole of democracy is critical in developing globally agreed variables, especially the SDG-12 on sustainable consumption and production, says the UN Secretary-General.\n"

Despite the recent dip in rates , experts don ’ t expect another refinancing boom like in 2020 and 2021 , when mortgage rates dropped to historic lows . Until mortgage rates move below 6 % , which isn ’ t guaranteed this year , refinancing activity is likely to remain limited . Most homeowners refinance to save money on their monthly payment with a lower interest rate . However , you might be considering refinancing for other reasons , such as modifying your loan term or type .

Trade negotiation leverage: Countries can use tariffs as a bargaining tool in trade negotiations, pressuring trading partners to lower their own trade barriers. In commercial real estate, sectors like construction and manufacturing, reliant on imported materials, face higher costs from tariffs. The headlines have been dominated by tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, trade imbalances and trade wars as the world markets respond to the chaos. What are tariffs?
